The staff here is great.  The food is standard McMenamins which has improved the last few years.  Of course they feature McMenamins beers and drinks.

2,"What's up Beaches?

After a couple weeks in SW Washington & Portland, I learned that locals don't go to ""the beach."" Instead, everyone goes to ""the coast."" Beach, please ... noooo problem. As long there is still a daily happy hour at Beaches Restaurant & Bar along the Columbia River, I'll be happy staying right here, Beaches. Actually, I'll be twice as happy because happy hours are twice a day.

Happy Hours:
Daily: 3:00 - 6:00 pm 
Late Nite: 9:00 - 11:00 pm

Monday is special (as it usually requires alcohol after work) with HH 3:00 - 11:00 pm. The menu and deals vary between the regular and late happy hours, so, feel free to mix it up.

Yo, Beaches, here's what made me happy:

 * Beaches 1/2 Pound Burger ($4) Basic burger ... Cheese is extra
 * Blue Cheese Balsamic Salad ($3) with Romaine, Broccoli Slaw, Kale, Pears, & Hazelnuts
 * Tater Tots ($2) seasoned with Cajun Spice
 * 6 Cheese Bayou Mac ($4.75) loaded with Chicken, Andouille, & Ground Sausage
 * Ra-diculously Amazing Rocas ($5.95) Signature dessert of Beaches is a traditional Almond Roca with Dilettante Chocolate Amaretto Sauce 

Of course, the main focus of any happy hour is the alcohol (hence the happy) and a few rounds of Log Yard IPA ($3.50) from Backwoods Brewery (WA) kept me very happy.

So, Beaches, stay young 'n free (or at least discounted for happy hour) and we'll be Beachin' friends for a long time.",Undefined,Good,Cheap
3,"I almost hate to write this, as clearly others have had a much better experience than we did, but...

We arrived at 11 on a busy Sunday. Got a spot on the patio. Our server came by after a few min and took our first round of drink orders, but first, he grabbed my girlfriend's phone off the table and started playing with it as it has a Nintendo case. This was a sign as to how inappropriate the service would become. 

A few min later, he dropped off our drinks. My beer was 2 min after the others & my glass was warm to the touch.  I remarked to the table that I thought the beer wasn't cold before confirming that with a taste. It was room temp. I let him know; maybe that keg wasn't chilled yet? I ordered a different kind of draught beer.  Still warm. I told him the system was messed up and got a bottle, which was cold. 

Time passes, other patrons on either side of us get seated and order. Finally, he takes ours. We had the chicken & waffles, Pecan French toast, and the biscuits & gravy. 

More time passes. My mom orders another mimosa. He was very attentive to up-selling booze, to his credit. He comes back 5 min later and drops a water glass half full of mimosa next to my 58 year old mother. We all sort of look at him, and he yells ""it's all good! Changin' it up a bit!"" He walks away. 

It's now about 12:15, which means its been an hour and 15 min since we sat down, and 30+ min since we ordered food. The other tables, who sat after us, have their food. My mom gets hers first. We wait. 3 min later, my girlfriend gets hers. I get mine another couple of min later. The tables to the left and right have been brought salt& pepper grinders, ketchup, and rolled cutlery. We have none of these things. 



The fried chicken & waffles was decent. They put some kind of chili powder in/on the waffles, which is a strange flavour and probably not the best compliment for the already spiced fried chicken. The French toast was good, but it's only 2 small-ish pieces, which isn't really enough. My biscuits& gravy were pretty bad. The biscuits hadn't been warmed, and because they were small, they formed two small, doughy rocks with a bit of cold gravy atop. The sausage was profoundly under-seared, which gave it a rubbery texture and a dubious food-safety rating. 

A full 2 hours later, we finally received our cheque. He asked (for the first time) how the food was. I replied that it was ""just ok."" He said ""yeah...it's kinda hard to take things off the bill, except for the warm beer"" and left. I hunted him down and paid our nearly $100 bill. 

As we left, we all remarked that we felt kind of sick. My girlfriend parted ways and my mom and I went back to my house where she laid on the couch, feeling awful. My girlfriend called me shortly after and told me she threw up. I felt sick and had strange sounds coming from my stomach but went to work. 

The next day, my mom decided to call and speak to a manager about our awful experience. There ""is no manager there. "" (why?) she left a message. She informs them that she is avoiding posting a horrible review by instead calling them to work it out. The next day, she calls again during service. No answer. She calls back 6 times and leaves 2 messages before finally calling AGAIN and reaching Chewy 5 days later, who admits he got the message the day before. She tells him everything that I explained above. He gives the following excuses:

""We got a new cooling system for the beer, and our staff don't  know how to use it. Plus the server would have to stick his finger in the beer to know it was warm."" Funny, because I have hands and eyes that can detect cold and hot. 

In response to the water glass mimosa, the wait time, and the staggered arrival of the food: ""yeah, they were really busy.""

In response to us getting sick: ""yeah, that's bad.""

He offers no solution, so my mom suggests that he call me. He says he will, that day. It has been 3 days since then. 

I manage a restaurant in Vancouver. Let me tell you what I would have done, and HAVE done in this situation: 
1. Trained my kitchen staff in FoodSafe practices as to not poison people

2. Trained my serving staff to adjust their casual, brotastic serving style to something more professional when serving 2 women, one of whom is old enough to be their grandmother in all likelihood, and neither of whom are interested in being screamed at/talked over/having their space invaded and belongings played with/flirting with you. 

3. Shown the server/bartender/manager how to monitor & adjust the cooler temp. 

4. Advise guests BEFORE THEY ARE SEATED that there could be up to an hour wait for food, so they have the option of choosing another place

5. Respond to phone calls from concerned guests immediately, so they don't end up posting really bad reviews. 

This is the longest & worst review I've ever posted, because this was the worst (and quite possibly the longest) dining experience I have ever had in Vancouver, if not ever.",Negative,Good,Undefined
4,"Half-price beer all-day Mondays and Thursdays!

You can take your local puny 2-hour happy hour and shove it twice a week. Oh, Brewtopia has a happy hour (3:00 - 5:30 daily) as well if you are looking for additional discounts on appetizers and grub, too.

Since I'd already eaten, I just popped into Brewtopia for a beer and to watch MNF on TV. For munchies, I got an order of the Hand-cut Fries ($6.99) with Sea Salt and Black Pepper. What the soft limp fries lacked in quality was made up for in quantity as the largest single serving of fries I've ever seen. Team Carbs!

Of course, Brewtopia is known for its variety of local, domestic, and international draft beers. I chose the most local beer of all: Loowit Shadow Ninja (Vancouver, WA) from the IPA section. With 50%-off, it was just $3.50. This ninja brew has a sneaky 49 IBU and 6.4% ABV.

Brewtopia is huge with a couple large projector TVs and probably enough seating for 100 people. It's also somehow connected to the Cinetopia theater in Vancouver Mall, but I didn't care or spend time to find out how. I also have no idea why it was empty with only a handful of customers. My hunch is that most folks don't yet know about the half-price suds. So, I repeat ....

5,"I am Afghani and Afghan Horsemen does not serve Afghani food.  They are serving food that is very similar to the Greeks! Afghanistan is not anywhere close to Greece, I don't know why do they say that one of the Afghanistan's main ingredients is dill?? That's wrong, Myself and my parents have never seen or tasted dill before in our life!  Taziki sauce WTF is that.. had no clue what it was until I had Opa!

Before meeting an Arab friend in Canada, I didn't know what a Domeh was until she fed me and said it's their traditional food.  We don't have any stuffed vegetables or vegg/beef stuffed grape wine-leaves. 

Yes, we do have bolani - pizza crust stuffed with potatoes & spinach.

Hey Afghan Horsemen, how about kofta? Meatballs cooked in delicious soup served with Afghani naan with a side salad of onions & green olives (big chunks of onions with salt sprinkled over and olives (yomyom)).

And us Afghans eat Salata (made up of tomato, onions, cucumber & cilantro) only with rice (which must be boiled in broth from beef stew) served with either chicken, lamb or beef.

And STOP serving tea in tea-packages! WTF! We make tea using the loose leafs only, with few cardamons in it. Stop charging for teas, it's an Afghan tradition, when ever a mehman (guests/visitors) comes to your home, you must do hather-dari (serve them) with green or black tea - and you must ask them whether they prefer green or black tea, and again STOP charging. That should be complimentary. Every ethnic restaurant must have a complimentary item on their menu! 

This place is obliviously run by NON-Afghan management because to be very honest with you readers, the food Afghan Horsemen calls Afghani food, is NOT Afghani at all.  

WTF is up with all the mis-match toshaks and pillows (seating cushion with pillows), why do they look so color-full, you are not in the business of selling garments for weddings, use one color and stick to it -  it's considered Cheap when you have multi colored linens for your toshaks & pillows, and wash them for once!  Also, wash all the drapes! They are dusty!! Dust off the chandeliers!

Stop using so much oil in everything - specially the vegetarian Sabzi-kind dishes! Gross!

7,"I've had tap water that was less bland than this! In a recent Globe & Mail interview, famous Chef Vikram Vij says ""I'm sick of Indian food"" ... and it certainly shows! I'm sick of his food too! You know how sometimes something is just so very bad that it comes back full circle and ends up being so good? This is not that. Good taste is diametrically opposed to Vij's. This is not Indian whatsoever. A good Indian resto may or may not cater to non-vegetarian patrons but in any case it full well needs needs needs to have excellent vegetarian items. ""Ahimsa"" is the Sanskrit term for the ancient philosophy of non-violence. And goddamn if my tastebuds and sensibilities weren't assaulted and offended. As a racially ambiguous and post-race individual with a mixed ethnocultural heritage; half Indo-Guyanese-Canadian and half Qu??b??cois-French-Canadian ... and having had Indian food in (to name a few places) my Indian grandmother's kitchen in Montr??al, restos in Montr??al, Boston, NYC, Vancouver, Los Angeles, Bangkok, Tokyo, Greenville S.C., London, Amsterdam and all around Northern India for like six weeks and having cooked Indian food for myself, my friends and my family since I was like fourteen years old ... I think I can definitively proclaim that this is not Indian cuisine whatsoever. It is more like pretentious pseudo haute cuisine ?? la fran??aise; a type of failed fusion involving some stale spices, bland lifeless portions and little effort. It might walk like a duck, it might talk like a duck but it's a chicken. Well, my fine feathered friends, the case with Vij's is exactly the opposite of anything delicious. While the toilet is spotlessly clean and the wine glasses are nice and the ambiance is okay but kinda loud  ... the food is meh. Vij's is beyond the hype. The hype waited two hours for a seat, finally got a table, chewed this place up, took some strong antacids and subsequently had violent gastroenteritis. I wholeheartedly affirm that Vij's probably at one point had a soul and was indeed a ""real boy"" ... but that was once upon a time ... that was before it sold its soul (and its ability to make good food) in a Faustian stroke of treachery in exchange for some paltry C-list notoriety. I'm sure the food was good when there was a place on Broadway but the hype burned it all to the ground. The hype killed it dead. The hype killed everything good about this place. Frankly, I'm embarrassed on behalf of Vij's, on behalf of Vancouver and on behalf of Canada and the CBC. There is such good, damned good, Indian cuisine in Vancouver. Isn't Vij's supposed to be one of the best Indian restos in the entire world? Nope, no Michelin stars here. Vij's just brings a knife to a gunfight. It brings a puerile scratch and an infantile pull of the hair, you know ... like a bottle rocket, to an all out Cold War style ICBM arms race. Seriously. This would be a total travesty if we didn't have the ghost of Christmas future to deal with. That ghost of Christmas future ... she wasn't a ghost, she was actually real; you never knew her name but she did make your iPhone when she was five years old ... with her small hands and big suffering in a Chinese sweatshop. Enough suffering; Indian food is supposed to envelop you in a sensuously warming glow of perfectly balanced flavour. It is ancient, nuanced, inclusive and scrumptious. It is the true and tested culinary science of spice. Indian food leaves you satiated and fulfilled. Vij's on the other hand ... gives you heartburn. Heartburn! Go to any five dollar Indian hole-in-the-wall in Vancouver and you'll have a delicious, filling and oh so wonderful meal ... without heartburn. But at Vij's you'll spend 250$ and it doesn't matter what you order ... you'll be served a ghastly and flavourless concoction of oiliness. There is a dearth of choice with the vegetarian options. The only thing worth eating here is the free amuse-bouche that they serve while you wait for two hours ... also the chai and mango lassi as well as their highballs are good. I love cardamom in any form. So, the food was meh. Please, please, just go elsewhere. Go to Chutney Villa on Broadway and Main or Annapurna on 4th Avenue or House of Dosas on Kingsway or Saravana Bhavana in the Toronto area or Thanjai in Montr??al. Anybody that has the gall to wait in line for this food whilst exercising common sense and acknowledging the multitude masses of humanity the world over for whom poverty and malnourishment are simply second nature...are yellow bellied posers with the intestinal fortitude of lily-livered chicken shits. Instead of standing in line here ... volunteer at your local InSite, take a stand and protest against institutional inaction concerning murdered and missing First Nations women in the Downtown Eastside and across Canada, build a home or bring clean drinking water to the Attawapiskat First Nation, go to Darfur and build a well or try to raise awareness about the global pandemic of violence against women.

8,"Olivia Z. and me both got crabs from Joe ... cause Joe's got crabs and isn't shy about sharin' ... as long as you're willing to pay the price.

Joe's Classic Steampot ($27) features Antartic King Crab Legs, Snow Crab Legs, Shrimp, and Smoked Sausage. Much like that coed in Cabo, it's a steamy and hot mess loaded with crabs. 

Olivia Z. and me doubled down on our crab fever by getting Joe's Classic Steampot for 2 ($46) with twice the crabs. Sharing means caring ... even if it's crabs, I guess.

We arrived on a slow night and lucked into $1 Oysters, too. So, it was impossible to resist getting a dozen of the 1 buck shucks to share, too. I have no idea what kind of Oysters were served, but they were huge ... Not the freshest, but probably the biggest and easily worth a dollar.

Since it was slow, service was fine until they started cleaning up for the night (2 hours before closing time). We had to skip a 2nd round of drinks, walk in search of service once, and then hunt for someone to bring us the check.

Joe's Crab Shack on the Columbia River ... with a view of the iconic I-5 bridge connecting Portland with Vancouver ... is an a-ok choice when you really, really want crabs and can't afford that exotic vacation like when you were younger.",Negative,Moderate,Reasonable
9,"After what was once my fave resto had served its course in GT, I wondered what would fill its welcoming space? Enter Keisuke Itoh (a silent partner with world-renowned chef Nobu Matsuhisa) and Takuya Motohashi's new casual chic Japanese eatery: Shirakawa. The restaurant specializes in Japanese sushi, teppan (iron) grilled high-end Kuroge Wagyu beef from Japan. 

The space was reminiscent of Boneta with a few subtle changes; an interesting new wall mural for one. The hostess and server were both welcoming and warm, as were the chefs that beamed smiles from the kitchen;  the food offered a refreshing new Japanese addition to GT. Since the place is new and they are just working out the kinks, it was relatively empty, but with the doors wide open it was a great place to spend a summer eve.

We skipped the steak because in truth, it's not really a steak place, but I would recommend every single thing that we ordered. 

1. Cocktails: while interesting, the list was short and too heavy for my liking; I opted for my fave. Joie Rose. If you are a fan of white with a bit more body, or a red that is slightly lighter given the welcoming summer heat, then this is the wine for you. It's one of my top 3 of all time. It's not sweet at all and yes--it's that good. 

2. Japanese pickles-assortment of vegetables marinated in amazu which is a Japanese sweet and sour sauce- delicious and a great start. 

3. Gastown Gyoza-pork, and mixed vegetables wrapped, served with spicy chili oil; Absolutely fresh and delicious. 

4. Nigiri- selection of 5 of our best cuts of premium sushi and tuna roll with black vinegar sushi rice. My fave was the ahi tuna; the bbq eel was also a hit if you enjoy eel.

5. Gyokai Risotto- grilled prawns, scallops, salmon served with snap peas and white cream risotto, finished with dried miso. The risotto was fresh and creamy and the seafood was all amazing. I especially enjoyed the prawns. 

6. Gindara- sakura chip smoked black cod, saut??ed mushrooms and sundried tomato. Melt in your mouth fish. A little broth might have added to the flavouring of the dish, but still a definite win.

Instead of dessert, we opted for another beverage. We left highly satisfied. My one minor complaint would be that the bathrooms were not too clean, which was odd considering that the place was 1/3 full. Overall, when craving something more grown up and tastier than Guu but less formal than Miku, this is the place for you; it comes highly recommended by me.",Positive,Good,Undefined
10,"This place sure does get busy.  If you are thinking you are going to just get a seat easily for lunch without a wait think again.  As we couldn't get in before a scheduled massage we decided to grab take out for dinner on our way back to our hotel.  Yup it was still packed with a wait when we went back to place our order and we were quoted a 25 minute wait to get our three dishes.  It was ready in 20 minutes and our food was soooooooooo good!  The service people at the front are in a rush so you get that type of rushed ""tell me of what you want so I can move the line and help the next person attitude""

We ordered green scallion pancakes which were made in the hong kong style and didn't need any sauce as it was already so tasty on its own.  We also tried the spicy seafood fried rice and spicy eggplant with shredded pork.  The fried rice was loaded with shrimp, squid pieces and lots of veggies.  Both dishes were amazing and if you are looking for spicy I highly recommend these two items! Yup we went to a restaurant known for dumplings and didn't order any dumplings.  My take on it is that you have to have it fresh and take out isn't going to be the same, especially if you have to reheat the food  They have an assembly line that you can watch through the glass kitchen windows constantly making fresh dumplings..  If we are ever back again in the Coal Harbor area we'll definitely have to try to get a table and have dumplings.

11,"We wanted some oysters so we stumbled in here even though it was pretty empty. It was a solid choice. The oysters were super fresh.

The fish and chips were also delicious. We opted for cod and the fish was chunky and hearty. The fries were just okay but the fish easily made up for it.

The service was great. Our server kept note of our beers and empty water glasses. And soon, the place was packed! It's pretty small though so I don't recommend coming during peak times with a group larger than 6.",Positive,Moderate,Undefined
12,"A few years ago, I had the luck of being on the Kona coast and enjoying the rich flavour of their coffee.  It's stayed with me as one of the best tasting coffees I've had around the world.  And I've had a lot great cups ... annnd terrible ones.  Every chance I get to savour that taste... I jump on it faster than Toronto fans jumping onto the Raptors bandwagon during play offs.   I saw this was a chain in Vancouver and was hopeful it was as good as my memory.

This location is quite large with several different tables available that are nicely spaced out.  It's clean and fairly inviting.  Green tones are prominent with a complimentary light golden wood providing the accent to an otherwise modern Nordic minimalist space.  The beans are proudly displayed upfront and yup, the Expensive Hawaiian peaberry beans are there.  Peaberry is usually only 10% of the crop yield so they're ridiculously Expensive but at $65 for a bag, I had to pause.  I only remember paying $35 at the coffee farm.  Inflation sucks. 

Service here is polite and efficient but with only 1 person manning the entire store.  It was never busy here... I was among maybe 6 other people.  But if it ever got busy, I would hate to be waiting for a drink.  Their menu reads more similar to a Starbucks than an independent.  They also have some tropical treats available if you want to nibble on something as you're using the wifi to work.  Most are either coconut or pineapple flavoured.

Hawaiian latte - According to the barista, she mentioned it's made with a macadamia and coconut syrup.  Upon first sip... yup. Absolutely there is syrup.  It's quite sweet and bordering on being too sweet.  The balance to milk is a little off as this is more almond milk than espresso.  I mean it's fine as a sweet drink parading as a coffee.  But wouldnt do if you needed a real coffee hit.  3/5

Cappuccino - Similar to the latte, this one was pretty unbalanced with too much stiff froth and a lot of milk used.  Definitely too weak as a cappuccino and even Timmys has more of a coffee flavour.  Overall, nice attempt but definitely not a cappuccino that is better than the corporate brands.  3/5

I didnt try the peaberry pour over because I wasn't sure they were even going to treat the beans right after the cappuccino and latte turned out not great.  I love Hawaiian coffee but I feel perhaps this spot wouldnt do it the best to give it the spotlight it deserves.",Neutral,Good,Expensive
13,"The place was packed with hungry men and ""workers"" but not a single female customer could be found on the premise. I don't usually judge by gender when reviewing a place, but I should have known that I was going for some ""hearty gristle that would put hair on my chest"" after a quick survey of the clientele. And I should have stopped right there. 

I also should have read Cathy's review, first. I used to go here when it was...good? Under a different name and owner, perhaps or perhaps my palette has changed since I am no longer a poor student? I had a chicken shawarma that was so ""gristled"" on the first bite that I almost gagged. Unlike subway, they hide the food from you as they make it so you can't see what you are getting. I was a bit disappointed as instead of fresh veggies, it was covered in pickled cukes and I couldn't really see any hummus or tzatsiki. So I'm not sure what I was eating.  I managed to eat the rest as I was starving and at $5.25 it was okay I guess. My friend ordered the lamb plate and he had no complaints; in fact, he boasted about the authenticity of the place. If this is authenticity, I'll take a pass next time, thanks. 

I went to the back to wash my hands...what a horror show. I wouldn't touch anything in there. I don't think that it had EVER been cleaned. I walked in, took one look and walked out. I was better off eating my food with dirty hands. I shudder to think of what the counters and cooking utensils looked like. Come to think of it, I'm afraid to look at the health inspection report now. What a waste of calories! 

Anyway, I left feeling a bit ill (yet full) and while a shawarma isn't exactly healthy to begin with, I don't think I'll be craving one of these for awhile. Yuck.",Negative,Moderate,Reasonable
14,"A couple weeks ago while in Vancouver we stopped in at Earl's Kitchen and bar. The restaurant was located a block away from the hotel we were staying at and looked like a nice place to have lunch. The space is beautiful with 40 foot ceilings and huge comfortable booths. There were Tv's with American college and Canadian football being broadcast. I think this is a chain restaurant since a saw another location in a different part of town. The menu is a hodgepodge of different cuisine item from burgers to pastas to nachos. We ordered the blacken salmon which was served with rice and veggies. The salmon was excellent the rice and veggies not so much. Along with the salmon we had the soup and salad which we choose the clam chowder and the Cesars salad. The clam chowder was good and the salad was huge but basic. 

Service was excellent. Our young server noticed my cough and suggested an herbal smoothie at a place down the street. Although I didn't follow through with the smoothie but it was nice of her to suggest.",Neutral,Good,Undefined
15,"It's easy to see why this place has such bad reviews: the service and menu is primarily in Mandarin.

However, if you can speak the language and are polite to the staff, you'll enjoy delicious, authentic dim sum. This place is frequented by an older generation, which ensures that the dishes are great because the crowd's been around long enough to know what is good and authentic.

The dim sum here isn't traditional or what you're accustomed to. There isn't the loud and bustling carts being pushed from table to table by ladies who try to give you more than what you want. Instead, the atmosphere is very quiet and serene. You order via a paper menu by selecting what you want and the quantity you'd like. Everything is made in the back kitchen and brought out to your table as it's ready.

Everything you could want from dim sum is available, you just need to know what it's called or describe it in a way that the staff understands. 

The egg tarts are the best and a great representation of how all egg tarts should be made. Each order comes with 4, and they're big enough to offer 3-4 bites apiece. The crust is very light, soft, and incredibly flaky. The egg custard is soft, doesn't taste very eggy, not overly sweet and baked to the perfect texture. They're so good we had to get another order to take home.

The pork shu mai and shrimp ha gow were excellent. The pork is extremely juicy, the shu mai is large in size, and everything is flavored and seasoned perfectly. The ha gow is packed with 2 large shrimp. The wrapper is the perfect texture and consistency as well: it's soft, slightly chewy with the right amount of stickiness.

I really enjoyed the Chinese donut wrapped in rice paper. The Chinese donut is deep fried and then wrapped in soft and chewy rice paper to provide a great complement of textures. It's extra crispy inside and then soft on the outside, and it's not oily. It's garnished with sliced green onions and a special sauce is poured over it table side.

The pan fried pork dumplings were huge and tasty. The filling was seasoned well, the meat is so juicy you'll have juice squirting out with each bite. The wrapper is perfectly made as well. It's a bit thicker, but still very soft. One side is pan fried to a nice golden brown and is slightly crispy.

The pork congee was pretty good as well. It comes with a good amount of rice porridge, small pieces of pork and a Chinese donut that's been cut and submerged on top. The porridge is very hot and has good flavor.


Don't let the large amount of negative reviews deter you from giving this place a try. I almost made that mistake and would've truly regretted it and would have missed out on some amazing food. The service does leave a bit to be desired, but if you're patient and courteous, you'll be just fine.",Positive,Good,Undefined

17,"Juniper crept up on my radar once it was suggested that it was the place for drinks after hours... with their cocktail menu and beautiful space, I was thinking this spot in Chinatown would be good.  I feel the photos don't do it justice.

Right near Bao Bei and on the western edge of Chinatown, the place is beautifully done.  We're talking subtle relaxed tones of grey highlighted by vibrant blues and soft woods.  Light filters in and it makes everyone look good.  Need a first date spot... this would be it.  There are many cozy spots and 2 dining spaces that you sit, sip, and enjoy in.  On a sunny Tuesday afternoon, the bar area was filling up slowly but still allowing for  nice conversation and chill moments.

Service here was friendly and prompt... they were always trying to see if there was another drink to be had or something off their happy menu we would bite into.  We primarily had eyes set on drinks as dinner was coming up else where.  I did spy a charcuterie board pass my table and it looked really good.  So taking a few pre-dinner bites is always welcomed.

Painkiller cocktail - They do cocktails really well here... flavours first but never skimping on the alcohol.  Sweet tropical pineapple with a citrus kick hits you first in your sip.  The mellow softer taste of coconut, rum, and a subtle warm spice of nutmeg comes afterwards.  It's sweet but not cloying...  the little umbrella makes this obnoxiously cute.  4/5

Black Beauty cocktail - This became my favourite after the first sip... darker garnet colours sits pretty in the glass.  It's not as sugary as painkiller but the blackberries keeps it fresh and sweet at first. Then the hit of peppercorn and something earthier creeps in... loved the spicier notes that round this out.  The addition of egg whites makes this a creamier texture.  They mention there is lemon infused vodka and more lemon juice itself... it's subtle but it just gives it more of that summer nights cocktail feel. 4/5

Amazing drinks and a gorgeous atmosphere... whats not to like and enjoy.",Positive,Good,Undefined
18,"Authentic Chinese food with a large menu that encompasses a broad spectrum of the cuisine.

The menu can be a bit overwhelming, but there are pictures for everything if you're unsure. The staff does a great job recommending items if you're on the fence between different things. One thing that you must order is the steamed pork soup dumplings. Each order only has 6 dumplings, so you might need to get multiple orders if you have a larger party.

Other items sampled were the shrimp and pork potstickers, pan fried garlic beef steak, spicy string beans with minced pork, fried rice with beef and XO sauce, pan fried beef dumplings, wontons with sour chili sauce, and the red bean paste pancake for dessert.

Everything we ordered came out fast, was freshly prepared and tasted delicious. Even in a fully packed restaurant, all the food was delivered promptly and came out faster than we could eat it, presenting the always welcome problem of not enough real estate on the table to put all the dishes.

The pork soup dumplings were plump and juicy. The wrapper was thick and resilient enough to contain all the soup, but was still soft and chewy. The pork had good flavor and was seasoned well. The dumplings are slightly larger than normal, which could be why there were only 6 per order.

The pan fried garlic beef was incredible. The beef was tender and succulent with great flavor. It was cut into very manageable pieces and the tenderness of it made it a joy to eat. The addition of garlic chips sprinkled on top enhanced and complimented the beef flavors.

The string beans were a bit overcooked, but still very good. I would've preferred them to have a crisper feel to them when I bite through them. The minced pork paired well and the sauce added a good level of spice without being overpowering.

The fried rice was one of my favorite items. The rice was cooked perfectly, wasn't sticky, had large chunks of beef and veggies, and the XO sauce enhanced the flavors of everything. The beef used in this preparation wasn't as tender or flavorful as the beef used in the garlic beef dish, and I found myself adding pieces of that beef to the rice to make it even better.

The potstickers were very well prepared. The skin is crispy on one side and soft and chewy on the other. A whole shrimp is used in the filling as well and it comes with a nice dipping sauce.

The beef dumplings were a bit heavy due to the wrapper. It felt more like eating a beef cake than a dumpling. The beef was juicy and the wrapper was crispy and flaky.

I wasn't a fan of the wontons because I felt it was undersized and didn't have the right filling to wrapper ratio. In addition to the skewed proportions, the sauce wasn't that good; it was too watery and didn't have enough flavor.

The red bean paste pancake was a great finish to a very gluttonous but delicious meal. The pancake was hot and packed to the brim with red bean. The pancake was soft and slightly flaky.

With so many different options to choose from, all of which are prepared well and taste delicious, this is a great place to get your Chinese food fix. The service is better than expected and they are pretty attentive and make good recommendations. The wait can be a bit daunting during peak hours, but the restaurant is very big, so a table will open up quickly.",Positive,Good,Undefined
19,"Alright.. so.. I'm VERY picky on my coffee drinks - mochas, lattes, americanos, etc, to the point that Starbucks and Cafe Artigiano are like.. meh. And I've been to independent coffee shops even around Montreal too and it's all just.. meh.

BUT THIS CAFE.. GODDAAAAAYUM.  

FIRSTLY, it's in the same building as the Vancouver Sympthony Orchestra which is super neat! My little sister who has autism, and I come here every week for her music classes. And after every class, we each get a drink and a dessert before our long car ride home in traffic which puts us in relaxation beforehand. 

Their chocolate chip cookies are incredible! They're big in size, soft and chewy which you don't see often! My sister is super picky with food but she can eat these in seconds!!!! So awesome! Their blueberry cheesecake as well holy f, to. Die. For. AND their croissants!!!! Oh honey. I can't even  delicious assss f!!!!!!  I've attached some photos of the drinks I've had and you could see that the baristas put effort and style into their drinks. AND YES, they're as good as they look! Hands down some of the best mochas and lattes I've ever had, and for the price?! Looooooord have mercy!  

Alright.. and the most important part of all my reviews.. customer service. 

I.. honest to god can't tell you enough of how outstanding, how amazing the owners and staff of this cafe are!!! The wife and husband who own this are fckin the sweetest people! They're super welcoming with the warmest smiles the second they see you, and greet you with such enthusiasm and bubbliness! They're also really funny and personable, and make conversation with my sister and I every time we're there. If they notice that you've seated down, they will bring your drinks and food to you! So you don't have to keep getting up to check if they're done! Sooo stinkin sweet! You can immediately tell that they care about their customers. Such a warm, family, type of vibe that you don't feel at other cafes!! 

The interior is gorgeous as well! It's really clean, and the staff are consistent at coming out onto the floor to tidy tables up after people are done, and to restock the refrigerator and dessert stand. 

Incognito is by far, my favourite cafe in downtown. If you're just visiting, or wanting to go on a cute little coffee date, or craving some seriously good coffee.. you MUST come here!!! 

They have Instagram as well if you wanna see more photos and what they're about!!

20,"I'm not sure how to tell my wife, but I spent a lonely night during the holidays caressing and getting cozy with Kris Kringle. It started innocently enough with a quick introduction from a cute elf at the bar. A few hours of guzzling, grasping, sipping, savoring, and slamming later, Kris Kringle had me jiggling like a bowl full of jelly. 

I got no regrets. I'm sure any man left alone with frosty Kris Kringle would of done the same, right? 

You won't always find Kris Kringle at McMenamins on the Columbia because Kris Kringle is a hearty and robust seasonal ""winter warmer"" with more hops than eight magical reindeer. However, just like the drunk Santa at the mall, Kris Kringle is 6.84% ABV.

Happy Hour is 3:00 - 6:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. to close daily. Didn't matter to me since I was already pretty happy cuddling up with Kris Kringle ($11.50 for a Happy Hour Pitcher). I guess Kris Kringle as a Pitcher would make me the Catcher. 

An order of Truffle Fries ($4.50) provided some fragrant nibbles to tease my senses. As my interest in Kris Kringle began to wane, I attacked a big McMenamins piece of manliness proudly hailed as Wilbur's Jumbo Deluxe. Like most big 'n beefy finds, Wilbur's Jumbo Deluxe Burger ($13.75) was made better thanks to Bacon, Tillamook Cheddar Cheese, and a Fried Egg.

Now, I can't promise that every man will find the same kind of satisfying night with Kris Kringle and Wilbur that I enjoyed. Perhaps Hammerhead or William's Terminator Stout will be more attractive to some guys. 

Happy Hour at McMenamins on Columbia offers a happy ending for men ... and probably women. Of course, it is called McMenamins and not McWomenamins, so, I'm not one to judge. Besides, next door is a place named for all them Beaches out there.",Undefined,Undefined,Undefined

The Mongolian meat  cuts are thinly sliced and the fresh vegetables make for a great meal.   The soups are also delicious  I enjoy tweaking my Mongolian recipe and love adding flavor with the different powdered spices and pre mixed flavors.

I'm still stunned - in an awesome way! Came to Coast tonight as a surprise venue for a birthday celebration (not mine) & whoa it was amazing!

Tiffany, Moncler, DeBeers, Gucci, Tory Burch, Prada, Brunello Cucinelli, Jimmy Choo, Van Cleef, Burberry, Saint Laurent, Hublot & Versace - are all within walking distance!

The Rolls Royce parked outside had my heart skip a beat - did I need to take out a small loan before walking in here!?! Yikes! 

Coast is friggin beautiful inside. I've passed by many times but wasn't expecting it to be so amazing! 

Coast is very classy, cool & sophisticated! The decor is highly supreme! 

Caught the tailend of Happy Hour. Hands down - one of the most awesomest HHs ever offering an excellent selection with great variety!

Brandon our waiter was marvellous!

Coast serves the freshest top quality seafood!!! 

Our birthday party had - Oysters, Brussel Sprouts, Garlic Prawns, Sable Fish Ribs, Crispy Calamari, Sushi Bowl & Fish Tacos! 

The birthday dessert - Key Lime cake with Caramel sauce had me almost licking the plate!!! 

Truly one of the best & most fantastic tasting HHs I've ever gorged down yet!!!

25,"Nice Mongolian syle grill, fill a bowl (or bowls) with meat, veggies serious sauces and give to the guy working the grill (don't look at the floor...)  he will hand it back to you and you sit down.  The food is good,  it comes with rice and a thin wrap plus (i am told, didnt try it) ice cream.

I came with a friend after a movie,  unfortunatly I wasn't hungry enoph to do the place justice.  It may have been timing but there were lots of empty contaners on the bars.  I did like my food and the service was good,  we got out with everything at dinner time for under $35 for two.

Its all you can eat so come hungrier then I did.  The place could use a good scrubbing.  Lunch is priced better then dinner,",Positive,Moderate,Undefined
26,"3.5 stars ... better than corporate spots and super fast.  To all those Vancouverites who went to Chipotle around the corner instead of this spot... I have to ask if do you not like flavour.  You have a great local spot 20 meters away! whhhy do Chipotle?  I believe La Taquieria Pinche has some good tacos... my bar is set high thanks for the delicious ones coming out of San Diego.  So for me, these are pretty decent and definitely deserving for you to try.  

For a lunch hour, this place was busy but the service here has things moving pretty quickly.  It looks like a bit of a diner from the 50s with it's linoleum flooring, cadillac turquoise coloured tables, and vinyl booths.  It probably has seen better days as well since most seating is cracked from the many visitors and time.  There are some 2 and 4 table tops but there's also bar seating and a shared communal table that most people would use.  

Service here is very nice.  The gentleman was really happy to share his favourites from the large menu choice.  They're also really efficient on taking orders and then firing immediately in the kitchen.  I think our behemoth order came in under 10 minutes after we ordered.  Maybe that's slow but I thought it was fast considering there was always 3 people waiting before you on take out as you ordered and at least 4 more behind you. 

The prices on these are really Reasonable with vegetables ones being $2.50 per taco and $3 for the meat ones.  Probably one of the better values for lunches we had.

Hongos Con Kale (Kale taco) - This was a mushrooms & kale braised & stewed in a salsa verde.  I have to appreciate La Taqueria for providing some vegan options ... especially when they use the hipster vegetable, kale. The mushrooms were really tender and absorbed a lot of the salsa verde.  Interesting vegan option but not my favourite of the day. It just needed more bite which could be added by the sauces but by itself, a touch more spices needed.  3.5/5

Rajas Con Crema (Creamed corn taco) - Another vegan option that I had to try.  Roasted poblano peppers are paired with creamed corn and then dollops of sour cream and Mexican cheese are on top.  I felt the Kale was missing a bit of flavour and the corn one had more with poblano peppers used.  It wasn't spicy at all but it had a bit of a mild tickle to let you know that you're not eating tofu.  3.5/5

Pescado (Fish taco) - A good baja style fish taco is one of my favourite.  The fish here was coated quite generously and fried quite crispy and a golden hue.  Whoever is working the fryer is doing a good job.  The unfortunate thing is that it was a liiiiitle too big for the taco shell (first world problems I know) and well, you couldnt fit any else on it.  Sure it had crunchy cabbage but it needed cilantro, pickled onions... something.  Sure it had a bit of sauce on it but it really needed something to lift it up past crunchy white fish.  Definitely add some sauce to give it some flavour.  3.5/5... could give it a 4.

Asada (Grilled flank beef taco) - The favourite of the table for the meat options.  This one wasn't grilled in the steak sense but more like cooked tender on a griddle perhaps.  Thinly chopped up, this was definitely had a good savoury (is beefy a word?) that the other ones just didnt have. 4/5

Carnita (Pork confit with pickled onions) - Super tender and just crazy juicy.  I think this is the one that exploded on first bite. Is that a good thing?  Perhaps but it leaves a lasting impression and scramble for paper towels.  As for the flavour, pickled onions were definitely needed to help cut through the pork and bring a bit of acidity.  Just to give it a bit of life. 
 So bring a bib... and a fried to help mop up the mess. 3.5/5

Tinga de pollo (chicken) - This one was shredded chicken with chorizo in a chipotle tomato sauce.  Another taco that requires you to eat quickly or have most of it sliding off your taco shell and onto your fingers, palm, table... you get the idea.  With a ton of sauce, this one is near impossible to eat without having it dribble down your hands.  You can taste a bit of the paprika from the chorizo in this one and definitely not spicy.  Need a bit of the heat from the sauces to perk it up.  3.5/5

Al Pastor (Pork) - This one confused the table as we couldnt really find that much pineapple to it.  We confused it with the other pork for a bit... of the meat ones, we found this one the most bland.  Though its cooked with chillis... its very mild in heat and flavour.  3/5

Horchata - OH YES. I absolutely refused to share this. ALL MINE. 4.5/5

Overall, there are a few that do stand out (Asada and Fish) with a few other ones that do much better than any corporate brands could ever hope to do.  I also love how affordable these are without any of the hipster attitude of charging $7 a taco.  I've been told that's just wrong and you can have a great taco at a lower price.  With La Taqueria Pinche, Vancouver definitely has some options.",Positive,Moderate,Reasonable
27,"With the majority of ramen shops offering pork based broths, Marutama bucks that trend by serving bowls of ramen made with only chicken broths.

Their signature chicken broth is creamy, rich, aromatic and very flavorful, serving as a great base upon which more flavors can be built and layered. It's much lighter in comparison to pork broths, but still has a great depth of flavor.

The contents of each bowl are fairly simple: ramen noodles, broth, sliced pork, seaweed and chopped green onions. You can add extra pork or a soft boiled egg to your bowl if you'd like. A vegetable ramen option is available as well. 

All the ramen can be made mild or spicy. There is a minimum order per guest, so you can't split a bowl between 2 people. The bowls are only one size, and they're about a medium. Extra noodles and broth can be purchased if you're not satisfied after the initial portion. 

I recommend getting the cha-shu tomago ramen with a mild spiciness level. This gives you a marinated soft boiled egg and pork slices so big that they need to be draped over the side of the bowl in order to fit everything else in it. The noodles are of the thin variety and cooked to a medium firmness. The soft boiled egg is cooked to perfection. When you break it open, the middle of the yolk is a vibrant orange and slightly runny. The pork slices are perfectly braised and seasoned. The meat is tender, flavorful and easily tears apart. There are some thin lines of marbling running through each slice for extra flavor. The seaweed is some of the best I've had and wish more places would use this variation. It looks very similar to kale, but it's not fibrous at all. Instead, it's soft but not mushy and has a very elegant flavor that compliments the chicken broth very well.

If you want to build more flavor in your bowl, there are small jars of sliced and roasted garlic chips, sesame seeds and chili flakes located in front of you. You can be as liberal as you want with all of them to create your ideal flavor profile.",Undefined,Undefined,Reasonable

29,"Ramen Danbo is that rare restaurant that makes you question life and determine that until now, all the other ramen you've been eating is swill.

As with many of my great foodie finds on the road (and some bad ones too), Danbo wasn't originally on my dining radar--until I saw a single-file line of people literally queued down the block in the rain for a chance to slurp the glorious delights within. New restaurant? Nope. Free food? Nope. George Clooney in the building? I wish. Normally in America I'd question the long line and think 'hype,' but this is Canada, and Canadians aren't stupid.

The original Danbo shop opened in 2000 in the town of Chikushino located halfway between Kurume on the southern island of Kyushu and Hakata in the Fukuoka Prefecture, the epicenter of Tonkotsu-style ramen. They focused on quality and taste and soon word spread, and so did they--all over Japan. This Robson store is one of four in North America (the others are in Seattle, Brooklyn, and a second in the Kitsilano area of Vancouver).

The ramen here is build-your-own and customizable to the hilt, which aside from the exceptional taste of the broth, is Danbo's biggest claim to fame. In most ramen shops I've been to, you can choose your protein or vegetal toppings. Here you pick everything from noodle thickness and firmness to the amount of lard, richness, and spice in the broth. At first, the level of choice was overwhelming. If the thought of endless possibilities makes you run for the hills, just order 'standard everything' and call it a day. Normally I advocate for the purveyor to dictate the vision for how their food should taste, but in this case, it was kind of cool to granulize, particularly to control the lard. I went with a 'light' quantity of that but you have up to an 'extra rich' on the Richter Scale. To quote the late great Julia Child, ""fat gives things flavor."" Over time it can also cause a coronary, so everything in moderation is my motto.

Simply put, my order of Miso Rekka Ramen was superb, arriving prepared with chashu (pork), scallions, and a dollop of their top-secret homemade karadare (spicy sauce). ""Rekka Ramen"" means that an additional layer of Ichimi Togarashi Powder gets added, which did its job to bring extra heat while not overpowering the flavor of the broth. Speaking of broth, Danbo's is based on a starter Tonkotsu pork broth and was savory without being salty or oily. The miso ramen builds on the base by using a blend of two types of traditional Japanese miso. Swirled within the broth were super fresh and firm thin noodles that had a nice chew. Meanwhile the locally sourced Yakibuta Chashu pork had both crisp and melt-in-your-mouth tender textures. Collectively, it was umami heaven, and in addition to being tasty, I imagine this hot bowl of happiness works well when Vancouver is sporting negative temperatures.

Wanting to experience more magical porky savoriness, we also shared an order of Chashu Pork Donburi, served as a small bowl of white rice topped with small chunks of tender pork belly. The braised chashu boasted even layers of meat and fat topped by fresh scallions and a savory sauce. This was a satisfying side dish and served to reinforce the high brought on by the ramen. Just when you don't think it can get any better, it does. 

The catch at reaching ramen utopia is that you have to wait, but typical of ramen shops, rest assured that the food here is efficiently served and the line moves quickly. Unlike the fast-casual places where there's one register open just to create a line and thus the appearance of popularity, this is a full-scale sit-down place that's turning over tables as fast as possible. After all, you sit, slurp, pay, and leave.

This is easily the best ramen I've had up to now and puts everything I have back at home squarely in the 'this is crap' category. In this case, the ramen at the end of the rainbow is well worth waiting for.",Positive,Good,Undefined
30,"If you like those infamous Xiao long bao (soup dumplings) from DTF, then Dinesty Dumpling House is the most authentic option in Vancouver.

We were seated right away and our order came out within 10 minutes. 

Our lunch choices::
****Xiao long bao: soup dumplings. These were good and the filling was flavorful.  

*****Spicy beef noodle soup~best dish IMO.  The broth was savory and the beef was tender.  The perfect match in a noodle soup.  The noodles were so good!!  You can tell they were fresh and possibly hand made. 

*****Shanghai rice cakes with chicken.  Another delicious option.  The rice cakes had the perfect texture.  So tasty!

31,"The taste of internalised European colonialism. Vij's is the most pretentious, un-authentic Indian food I've ever eaten. Over priced and tasteless. This place has often been touted as a more ""refined version of real Indian food"". If he had any understanding of flavours in general he would know that a cuisine that's been masterfully crafted for 1000s of years does not need the kind of refinement that someone with a limited understanding of food can single handedly give. But granting that he is refining it (ignoring the white washing for a second) - this should imply that the food would be perfectly cooked with harmonious flavours which is not the case at all - I've had powdery, burning chilli powder in my biriyani and rubbery over-cooked shrimp. I've had infinitely better cooked food in roadside inns for 50 cents. 

Real gourmet Indian food is found in every major city in India where everything is prettily presented, is delicious and perfectly cooked. Call it refined if you will. As long as it only enhances the flavours and presentation of the real cuisine instead of watering it down and killing its roots and its soul. 

In comparison this place is crude. There's no real refinement of presentation or taste. A real stain on Vancouver's otherwise great culinary scene.

Update: It's a little disturbing when a business owner sends you personal insults 6 messages in a row over the span of a week. No replies to any of his messages at first pushed him into sending me sexist and racist personal remarks which I posted below.

In my personal opinion these unwanted private messages absolutely reflect upon on a business's practises. If anybody is interested in seeing these please contact me privately. Again this is my opinion but I believe that it is every customers right to see the true nature of a business they are endorsing.

They're hard to come by. Thankfully enough while in Vancouver, we stumbled upon this unassuming spot not only right down the street from our Airbnb but also conveniently located next to the Commercial/Broadway Sky Train Station. What luck!

And one of the most unique aspects of Marulilu is that they serve breakfast - Western and Japanese style - all day! While I didn't actually go for a full on breakfast (I almost got the waffles) I made sure to try their hash browns recommended by another Yelper. And boy was I happy I listened to her - you'll be too once you give it a try! Now onto the main dish - my Wild Salmon Risotto! The risotto was essentially a creamy porridge made with puffy rice, smoked salmon bits, and Parmesan cheese which made it all super hearty! The aji fry on top was also a nice touch as it was crispy, meaty, and deboned despite being a mackerel fish. On the other side of the table, my boyfriend ordered the omurice with tomato sauce. It was amazing as well since the egg was fluffy and the tomato sauce was flavored immensely, with a Japanese flair. 3/3 everything was on point. 

Though it was my last day in Vancouver, I'm happy that I was able to dine here and finish my eating adventure in Canada on a good note. I just wish I was able to take back a few more of those hash browns - they're so addicting! And so, I'm going to end in this: If there is any takeaway from this review, ORDER THE HASH BROWN. You'll understand why ;) Marulilu's tops any hash browns I've had so far including McDonald's - my all time favorite.",Positive,Good,Undefined
33,"3.5 stars... a notch above any regular spot but a few misses.

Thierry Chocolaterie and Patisserie tries to bring a bit of the French pastry scene to the downtown Vancouver.  It sits in the same upscale neighbourhood where you can find Tiffany's, Laduree, and consulates.  It's where you find lawyers dressed in robes quickly grabbing a drink and croissant between cases, yoga moms with their big baby strollers, and ladies who lunch.  

It is a bit like a French bistro with it's cute little patio outfront with it's overhang offering some shade from the bright sun.  The inside is all shades of the chocolates... molten brown warm hues are everywhere and then dashed with a bit of golden gleam.  Seating inside is limited. Though it is half the space indoors, there are only maybe 8 small tiny tables inside.  

The offering here on a weekday is not much but they do have a full espresso bar with many packaged sweets.  The actual patisserie place had only 4 items with 2 larger cakes and then they had some vienoisserie in another case.  I would have liked to try some of the pastries but for an early morning walk, I was feeling more of their famed mocha and I've heard of their croissants being quite good.

Mocha - I love when a chocolatier using their own chocolate to blend in the espresso and milk to make this.  Soma and Soul chocolate are a few small bean to bar chocolatiers in Toronto that do this wonderfully.  I was hoping the same and ... it just missed the mark. The chocolate is a nice tempered bitterness but there was too much milk and water.  Not enough coffee or chocolate to make this more than a watery diluted drink.  A shadow of what it could be. 3.5/5

Cappuccino - Same results as the mocha but except it has less flavour because of no chocolate.  It's watery and lacking coffee notes of any kind.  I understand this is a pastry focused spot but cappuccino and a slice of cake is a perfect afternoon snack? 3/5

Almond croissant - This fared better than the drinks.  Good clear delicate layers sit on top of each other and filled with a generous smear of marizipan and dusting of almonds.  The croissant itself is buttery but not light... it's baked up perhaps to the point where the delicate buttery layers becomes hardened crust instead of emphereal buttery whispers. 3.5/5

I think there are a lot of great potential flavours and the cakes do have a wonderful charm to them but for the drinks and croissant, it just didn't live up to the reviews previously done.",Undefined,Good,Undefined
34,"3.5 stars for the market... love the idea of bringing the best of Canadiana food items into one spot.  

Edible Canada has two parts to their place in Granville... one the larger sit down restaurant and the other is a cute little market that sells all things delicious and Canadian.  This review in particular is for the market side.  

I stepped in here not knowing what to expect but I was really delighted to see many local delicacies and highly specialized brands across Canada found here.  Everything from rich and dark Quebec maple syrup, smoked salmon, pate, cured sausages, tons of sauces and spice mixes, and chocolates all across Canada.  I even spied a few here that were from small batch Toronto artisans.  For Edible to take the time to find these wonderful little food artists and then bring them to one spot... just love this.  

What I paused though was the price point... I understand that they had to ship them across the country and probably not very large amounts.  So shipping is weighing heavy on them.  For some of the Toronto chocolates, even with shipping... it was clearly better to get it direct from the artist themselves.  I guess that's the price of convenience.  I love coming here to learn more about the different brands and just see what's available.  As for actually purchasing, it was a bit harder to make that decision especially if that food artisan is only a drive away back home.  Cute spot on Graville though!",Positive,Good,Expensive
35,"Food and service are both very mediocre. Prices are decent.

Came here with a group of friends for dinner one night. Got seated in the back in a booth which was nice. We ordered a bunch of rolls to share and everything tasted very mediocre. The rice was cold and hard for all the rolls, so the rice was definitely not freshly made but rather refrigerated previously. The quality of fish is also very mediocre. 

Service was ok, I had to ask for my tea to be refilled several times. Bathrooms are not super clean. Street parking was pretty easy at the metered spots around the area, but this was on a weeknight.",Positive,Bad,Reasonable
36,"Beer: the final frontier. 

These are the voyages of an enterprising Yelper. His five-year mission: to explore strange new Couve, to seek out new brews and new ales, to boldly go where no liver has gone before.

Flying solo, a cold pitcher of draft IPA beer made sure this pub would be my final frontier of the night while a succession of bar food kept me distracted from my lonely planet of one. Nachos and $0.50 Chicken Wings were the grub I expect in a pub while Bacon-wrapped Jalape??os and a Wedge Salad wondered if I'd live long and prosper. 

I totally didn't need dessert, but when it comes to Bread Pudding, resistance is futile. So, ya, I got that, too. It was a lot of food and beer and then more beer and more food, but dammit Jim, I'm a Yelper, not a doctor!

In this bar, this Frontier Public House, a buzzed world awaits of inebriated civility and lost sobriety. Whether you've gone before or not, go boldly and boldly go where everyone else has been. - Beer, 2016.",Undefined,Moderate,Undefined
37,"Forget bars or clubs, Thierry Chocolaterie Patisserie Cafe is THE place in Vancouver to hang out. Located just one block from the main Robson drag, it is a dessert hotspot that opens for the breakfast crowd at 7 a.m. and closes with the drunk and stumbling at midnight every day of the week.

Named after acclaimed ma??tre p??tissier, chocolatier, and chef Thierry Busset, Thierry is a Vancouver institution with a sweet reputation for handcrafting petits fours, Viennoise, cakes, tarts, macarons, and exotic chocolates. They do it all in a setting that is equal parts cafe, shop, and atelier.

Across a handful of visits I tasted several macarons, cookies, chocolates, and shared a raspberry yuzu tart. The tart had the appearance of a classic French tart, not surprising since Chef Busset hails from France and learned the art of patisserie from masters in Auvergne and Loire Valley. However, the twist was in the ingredients. What would normally be sweet pastry cream was instead a yuzu sabayon filling which delivered a tart note, reinforced further by slivers of ginger and contrasting well with the slightly tart, slightly sweet raspberries beautifully arranged on top. Holding all of this together was a sugarcane base instead of the more traditional shortcrust pastry shell, hard and crumbly rather than hard and flaky. As a dessert it was delicious and unique.

The Breton, a butter cookie with sea salt, was as expected richness galore juxtaposed with salty notes. The chocolates here, meanwhile, are made in small batches in a temperature-controlled room viewable from the front of the house. They may look delicate and small, but they're rich and filled to the brim with both classic and unique fillings. My pick of pistachio (of course) featured dark bittersweet chocolate on the outside and was filled with white chocolate, pistachio, and gin, taking the ordinary and making it anything but.

Half orders of caramel and hazelnut 'liquid chocolate' were decadent and indulgent but thinner than I expected. I could barely discern the caramel flavor in mine. Overall the drink was less rich than anticipated, which may have worked to my advantage considering the richness of everything else I consumed.

The macarons here were decent but definitely denser, not as sweet, and not as chewy when compared to Ladur??e, the macarons by which all other macarons are judged. To their credit, Thierry's flavors seemed to veer away from some of the more traditional ones--no pistachio, rose, or vanilla here, for example, but you will find coconut lime, lemon, and lychee. Fruit-flavored varieties have a buttercream center while others are filled with ganache, such as the salted caramel and matcha ones I tried.

As a venue, Thierry is both modern and comfortable, but my biggest gripe about the place is that it needs to be twice as big to keep up with demand. There are only a handful of tables inside and outside on a covered patio so if you order your dessert or drinks for here, chances are you won't be able to sit down to enjoy them. Entire groups congregate for hours in the trendier-than-Starbucks setting and even if a table miraculously opens up, it's not bussed so you'll need to eat with someone's trash and dirty dishes in your face. The entirety of the staff seems focused on taking orders and making drinks.

Thierry's popularity is partially due to the aforementioned extensive hours. While other popular dessert-centric places such as Ladur??e clock banker's hours, Thierry is open late like any number of patisseries, gelaterias, and cafes in Europe where the night-life scene is about socializing without an alcohol-focused itinerary, unlike the USA. Much like Juliette & Chocolat in Montreal, Thierry evokes a classic Parisian vibe and is simply a chill place to hang out.

If you've been to Vancouver you also know that the city has the highest population density in Canada with over 5,400 people per square kilometer and is the fifth-most densely populated city with over 250,000 residents in North America, behind New York City, Guadalajara, San Francisco, and Mexico City. Unlike sparsely populated city centers where people merely work and then flee town leaving it lifeless and deserted after hours, metro Vancouver is bustling at all hours of the day and night. Thus core businesses like Thierry serve not only tourists but also the abundance of people who live in the heart of the city.

Thierry is well worth a visit for a morning cappuccino and croissant, a leisurely lunch, or a post-dinner dessert and drink indulgence. The myriad options within bring a bit of Paris to Vancouver, but just keep in mind you might not be able to enjoy any of it sitting down.",Undefined,Good,Undefined
38,"* Huh?  What?  Really? *

UBC has long been known as a space devoid of any good coffee or food - for as long as I've known UBC at least!

This new cafe opened up, and I heard it was nothing like any coffee out at UBC that has been offered before.  So, being a coffee lover, I just had to check it out. I thought to myself, ""It couldn't be good, right?""

Parking?  That stinks. It is UBC.  Duh.  Thank you, Car2Go for having convenient spots nearby!  :)  

I ordered the espresso ($2.25), with great doubt I may add.  Yes, the cafe looked modern and third wavey, but come on, this is UBC.  It couldn't be good, right?  

I noticed they were serving Pallet beans - which was an interesting choice that made me really wonder, will they be handling the beans correctly?  The guys at Pallet seem pretty fussy about letting their beans get mishandled, so perhaps?  But no, it couldn't be, right?  

While waiting for the espresso I filled a self-serve glass with water from the nice glass serving container which was filled with water and orange slices.  Nice touch - but just decoration dressing, right? I assured myself, ""The coffee couldn't be good, right?""

The barista called my name, and I picked up my espresso.  The crema actually looked good. Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/loafe-cafe-vancouver?select=3QCStXnyTfjwfd9ClWHzAQ

But it must have been an optical illusion, because the coffee couldn't be good, right?

I settled into a nice table and got ready to taste.  I tasted thinking, ""yeah, yeah, it looks good, but it couldn't be good, right?""  

And my next thought was, ""Huh?  What?  Really?""  

I put down the cup.  Took a sip of water. 

I blinked my eyes.  I was awake.

I pinched myself. I was awake.

I looked for disturbances in the matrix. There were none.  

I took another sip. And I thought again, ""Huh?  What?  Really?""  

So it is official. UBC now has good coffee.  And that still makes me think, ""Huh? What? Really?""

I have to return and try the sandwiches, because they couldn't be good, right?!?!?!?!?",Positive,Good,Reasonable
39,"Butteriest.
Pizza.
Ever.

I can't decide if it's the butter lathered on the crust or Bortolami's special cheese blend of Mozzarella and Provolone that makes this one of my favorite pizza joints in Vancouver. The pizzas melt in your mouth like butter, but better because it's pizza

Sign up for the VIP club to get $5 off with every $100 spent cause once you fall in love with Bortotami's Pizzeria, you'll quickly hit the Benjamin level thanks to addictive buttery pizza made from fresh dough and fresh sauce.

Only getting 1 pizza? Get the Cima Coppa Pizza with Teriyaki Chicken, Garlic Ranch Sauce, and drizzled with Teriyaki Sauce. Even better? Get a half-n-half pizza with a Gregario Pizza made up of Ham, Pineapple, Bacon, Chicken, and that famous Mozzarella & Provolone cheese blend.

Bortolami's has three other cheese options if you don't want the blend or want to add to it including Cheddar, Parmesan/Romano, and Feta cheeses. They also have gluten free crust for an up charge or a low carb (thin crust) option. Don't forget to bring a Growler for Beer fills at Reasonable prices, too.

Again, the Cima Coppa is one special pizza and the Gregario is pretty hard to pass up, but if you want to explore others. check out these alternatives:

 * An almost spicy Mondiale Pizza with Chicken, Frank's Hot Sauce, Ranch Dressing, Red Peppers, Green Peppers, and Cheddar Cheese

 * A Mexican-themed Vuelta Pizza with Refried Beans, Beef, Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Olives, Red Onion, Salsa & Sour Cream

 * A meaty Pink Jersey (aka Maglia Rosa) Pizza with Salami, Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, and Ham

 * Feta & Strawberry Bruschetta with toasted Ciabatta, Feta Cheese, and organic Strawberry Jam

 * Jalapeno Bruschetta with toasted Ciabatta topped with Cream Cheese, Jalapenos, and Cheddar Cheese.

 * Pane Pasticciato (aka Pull-apart Bread) baked fresh with Garlic, Olive Oil, and Italian Herbs. Get it topped with Cheese cause it's nearly better than the pizzas.

Bortolami's Pizzeria has a cool cheese blend, a simple VIP club, cold local draft beers, crazy good cheese bread, and possibly the butteriest pizza ever ... making Bortolami's one of best pizza options in The Couve.",Undefined,Undefined,Reasonable

Ghost ... Runners ... in the Couve.

Small-batch craft beers brewed from the production-only Ghost Runners Brewery in Vancouver, Washington may be only a few years old, but local bars and restaurants know a good thing when they drink it. 

Ghost Runners has been selling their hand-crafted beers at dozens of local establishments like Killer Burger, Blind Onion, Twilight Pizza, Tommy O's, Pizza Schmizza, and Bortalami's for awhile, but I had the pleasure to join a private event at their production facilities. Oh the folks behind the brewery were charmers, but the real pleasure was drinking a variety of their seasonal brews ... and loving each of them. 

Their motto is ""You deserve a great beer."" and all I have to say to that is, ""You're right, I do.""

Here's what I had the chance to Ghost Run 'n Sip:

 * Boston Irish Red Ale 6.8% ABV; 40 IBUs
 * 5k IPA 6.4% ABV; 95 IBUs
 * Negative Split Stout (Nitro) 6.8% ABV; 35 IBUs
 * Hellacious Repeats Double IPA 8.4% ABV; 85 IBUs

Each beer at Ghost Runners Brewery bears a running-themed name because the owners are hardcore runners ... perfect for blending healthy lifestyle choices with a true love of beer. 

Anyway, I know I had you at beer. So, keep an eye out for Ghost Runners on tap at your local pub and then stop by their production facility when you want to order your own batch or fill your own keg or growler.",Negative,Good,Undefined

43,"With so many wonderful accolades on Maenam, this seemed to be the perfect restaurant to try that wasn't west coast farm to table.  They're on Vancouver's best restaurant list and even in Canada's Top 100 restaurants.  Like I said... well regarded for it's flavours and service.  In Toronto we have our own regarded fine dining Thai restaurant but it hasn't seen the same awards or nods as here.  In comparison, I'm a bit of a loss at what happened to the Thai flavours in our dishes.

Maenam is right beside my other 2 fantastic discoveries in Kitsilano... Fable and Rain or Shine ice cream.  It's a nice spot ... modern warmth but leaning towards the minimalist.  The golden hues of the many wood panels help keep the noise level down.   It's needed a bit as we could clearly hear the tables beside us and their family debates.  

Service here is efficient and quick but we were missing any of the warmth or active interest that we experienced in Fable or Nightingale.  It just seemed... a bit functional and that's it.  There's nothing wrong with it but I would hope service be a bit more welcoming for a restaurant of this calibre.

The menu reads really well with a lot of variety of vegetarian, seafood, and meat dishes.  A lot of interesting dishes that go beyond the mundane pad thai and khao soi.  With a bit of help from the staff, we were able to pick 3 dishes to start and see where it takes us.  I'm honestly glad we did this cause we were struck on how small these plates were for the price point ... especially compared to the amazing dinner at Fable a few days before.

Brussel Sprout Salad - This was a nice side to have ... sprouts cut thick and then fried up crisp.  There is an Asian-esque sauce that is savoury and leaning towards a darker soy flavour.  But one thing that I noticed quickly... good but not Thai.  It was missing the sour bright citrus or the pungent fermented notes of fish sauce. Yes there was an underlying sweet note but then it just resembled a sweet soy sauce which could be Japanese or Indonesian.  3.5/5

8 Spice ling cod - This was a main but what arrived was more of a shared plate portion.  Smaller definitely but not minuscule.  I believe whoever is cooking is executing well as this one had tender soft cod encrusted in a hot crunchy crust that wasn't too thick.  That was well done but the sauce is where it faltered.  Yes it was a nice garlicky thick glaze that had a sweet undertone to it but ... once again, it was missing the Thai flavours. 
 No acidity, bitterness, or pungent flavours... just soy, garlic, and sugar.  And the sauce was quite syrupy sticky... it ruined the crispy crust quite quickly.  3.5/5
 
Stir fry of beef rib & holy basil - Tender beef rib was easy to tear into with just a fork.  This dish had a bit more variety of vegetables thrown into it and giving it more visual appeal.  I liked this one a bit more as it didnt have a stick glaze that just made every bit too sticky.  The only big issue again is flavour.  It's not bad but it's just generic Asian.  It's missing the Thai undertones ... no sour, sweet, or pungent.  Just soya sauce with a hint of herbs.  3.5/5

I would say that the overall execution and cooking of the dishes were good... nothing was wrong there but the flavours were not Thai.  Perhaps this is modified to suit a more North American palate but I was hoping more of the boldness and sharp balanced tastes that I've come to appreciate in the cuisine.  Comparing this dinner to a few doors down at Fable, this one was more Expensive for considerably less good food and flavours weren't a stand out.  It's unfortunate but I can't recommend this spot for good Thai food.",Neutral,Moderate,Expensive
44,"Oh Pizza Farina you were so on my list for favorite pizza joint in Vancouver until just over a week ago.  The pizza was fantastic as usual but unfortunately someone there needs to brush up on her people skills and treat others with respect.  Such a shame!  

Of course being that it was a Saturday night, it was busy and crowded in there.  We luckily got seats at the window which was great for people watching out on Main Street.  Two men came in with their elderly father, which was super cute and yes they had been drinking a little bit but they weren't obnoxious or rude.  

One went to order pizza while the other managed to secure some seats for their father at the big communal table.  The one brother seemed quite excited to be eating there and said ""I hear this is the best pizza in the world."" which made us laugh as they were so excited to be eating there. 

Now this really is the only comment I heard him saying as once they sat down they weren't as loud.  Keep in mind if they were really loud we would have heard more as we were right across from them.  Next thing a women who works there came up to them and mentioned that they were being disruptive and creating a scene and said she noticed that they had been drinking before coming in. It was a very unnecessary comment.  Then she came back about 5 minutes later and was on their case again by telling them they were being disruptive and loud.  One of the men asked her what her name was and she rudely said ""I rather not tell you"".  Eventually one of the men left and slammed the door behind him.  Right when that happened my response was ""that was justified"".  A woman sitting next to us turned to me and said why was that justified?  My response to her was because the lady working there was rude to them and they didn't deserve to be treated that way.  They were just two brothers taking their elderly father out for dinner.   The saddest comment was a few seconds later when we were getting ready to leave and the other brother says to his father I hope they don't do anything to our pizza now.

In fact, were to be an earthquake or apocalypse, I'd lament until the moment I cease about not having the opportunity to eat supreme for my last meal on earth. 

But as my distinguished hostess, Crystal H, showed me, not in Vancouver. No, no! Not with this stylish, unique little Japanese Fusion izakaya joint that combines quality ingredients with a potpourri of global influences. Not to be missed is their signature ebi chili mayo. Sure, the purists will wrinkle their noses, but can you really argue with deliciously plump shrimp battered into a golden puff and topped with spicy Kewpie? Get jealous, doughboy.

And what about crab and avocado with a mountain of soy fermented seaweed atop mixed greens? Want indulgence? It comes in the form of tuna tartare with a dollop of pop-in-your-mouth caviar. The duck and the service were the only things lacking. Wash it all down with a fresh fruit cocktail, just pick your fruit and base. My John Collins was so real there were seeds floating on top.

46,"Ok, this place is five stars all the way. 

Order lingcod fish and chips, dairy free clam chowder to go which is awesome on a cold day, and Vancouver Island root beer to stay local. The clam chowder is a meal in itself and is absolutely delish.

It's Vancouver's (not so new, but it still feels that way to me) number one fish and chips spot and it is as good as In-N-Out in SoCal, but with fish of course. Also, one piece is not enough, especially when the fish is this light and flaky. And mine lasted on the drive home for take-out, too.  My only complaint is that my portion must have been smaller than those mentioned in other reviews because I practically inhaled the fries and fish no problem and that is not usually the case at some other rival fish and chip mongers. So that one is a bit of a mystery. 

The coleslaw is also quite tasty but not really my thing; if they aren't too busy they might even make you a salad which is awesome.

48,"The food isn't bad the service isn't horrible and I would be a regular customer if the workers/servers there aren't trying to rip me off CONSTANTLY. The first time my boyfriend and I went there, we ordered two special subs and two soda water with lime. The price on the menu for the subs are $4.50 each and the drinks are $3.55 each. The subtotal should be $16.10 before tax and tips. When we went up to the cashier to pay, the subtotal was around $20. Back then I didn't think about the price and paid $20+ tips.

I came here a second time, ordered the exact same thing (because the food was really good) and AGAIN we got ripped off the same price. Again, I didn't argue but I took the take out menu and calculated it again when we were in the car and realized that we were being scammed around $5.

The third time my I went, he ordered the special sub, the soda water with lime, and I ordered a chicken pho. The subtotal price should be $16.30 but our bill was $16.50. Whatever. 

Last night, I went again and ordered 2 special subs, 1 soda water with lime and one soda water with salted lime. The subtotal should be $16.10. We were ready to argue with them should they overcharge us. And they did. When we went up to the cashier to pay, the guy was adding up the price on CALCULATOR hidden from our view instead of using the cash register. He said that our total was $19.52. I thought maybe it was a mistake, so he kindly asked ""so that price is including tips?"" And the guy said no. Then we started to break them down.

He took out his cell phone and showed how the prices are broken down and the total should be $16.10 + tax + 15% tips would equal to $19.44. The guy seems to remember prices of the items AFTER tax and said the drinks cost $4.50 after tax. I took out my phone and showed them that a $3.55 drink + 5% tax is $3.72 so how would it be $4.50?!! I don't remember the exact price of the sub they told me, but it definitely did NOT reflect the menu price. The guy who was charging us seemed a bit flustered so another server guy came over and we explained the situation to him. After we showed him the breakdown of the costs and such, he said ""oh the price of the menu just changed 10 days ago."" This is an absolute lie since the first time we got overcharged, it was around two months ago. 

I told them that this overcharging has happened before, then the guy #2 said ""I'm not the manager, you have to come in and talk to the manager."" Guy #1 was still saying the drink costs $4.50 after the menu. He kept contradicting himself since he insisted that the price of the drinks IS the same price on the menu ($3.55) but after 5% tax it's $4.50 when it's CLEARLY isn't. Whereas guy #2 said they are going what the manager said....and then the menu just happened to change 10 days ago. So many lies!!

All in all, the food is fairly decent and they have quite a bit of customers, so I don't see why they're ripping money off people. If you're going to eat, just do the math before you pay!!!

49,"The Vancouver Fish Company recently claimed the former Whet Bar space. Judging by the first couple days of opening by Managing Director Leigh Angman, brother Todd (Relish) and Steve Duyzer, (formerly GM at Stanley Park's Fish House and Exec. sous chef), they have already managed to blow their competition right out of the water! 

Just after 24 hours of opening, we decided to check it out and it did not disappoint. From the time we entered until departure, our service by Ben and surrounding waitstaff was warm, friendly and welcoming. I would definitely return (as a local) and recommend to tourists, too. (And if you know me, I don't recommend anywhere on Granville Island.)  Finally, a place that has found its sea legs! 

Order: decent wine list; my favoured Sandhill Viognier was not offered by the glass but they made an exception. I was starting to like this place already and I hadn't even tried the food! The wine selection seemed pretty decent by the glass, but was better by the bottle. 

Smoked Trout Dip- smoked to order lake trout, zucchini & spinach, pickled vegetables, fry bread -$16.99 Although the fry bread did not match the amount of dip (don't you hate that?) for an extra $3.99 we ordered more. This was one of our favourite dishes. Upon our server's recommendation, we chopped up the trout to mix in with the dip. Delicious! It would have been nice had there been enough fry bread to begin with however. Bread is Cheap; come on guys! As good as it was, a bit overpriced, all things considered.

Green Goddess Salad- sweet West Coast greens, roasted tomatoes, cucumber, pumpkin seeds, goddess dressing- pretty standard, but also quite tasty and nicely presented. 

Smoked Salmon Sockeye lox, dill cream sauce, mozzarella, provolone, pickled red onion, capers $17.99 - We were hyped up for the pizza after trying the fry bread. While there was an adequate amount of salmon which can be sparse on this type of pizza, nary a caper was to be found which was a bit disappointing. I found myself longing for a small lemon slice, too, as this is a dish that I often make at home, and a bit of acid to offset the fishiness goes a long way.

Trio of fish: salmon, ahi tuna and arctic char, this was also beautifully presented and did not disappoint. Next time, I would just order the salmon as that was the definite hit. The potatoes and few pieces of asparagus and carrots accompanied well, but if only there had been a few more. These things are inExpensive, so why not add on just a few extra?

Maple Creme Brulee with Peanut Brittle and a Maple Chocolate- the brulee did not taste as fresh as it could have been and was just okay, but the brittle and the chocolates were the hit here. Not a bad finish to the meal, however.

So, all of this for three people at roughly $60 per person with a 20% tip and we were not disappointed. While a bit pricey for what you get, like most places on the ""island"" you do pay for the view, but finally we could dine at a place with some brains to match the braun.

50,"Tracy Stern is a little bit Marie Belle (quaint, beautiful chocolate shop) and a little bit Chocolate Bar (cool, hip, orange, modern decor)--both in NYC--and it was fun to reminisce about both on my last two visits here. And that's a good thing! 

My first time here I ordered a chicken focaccia sandwich at $9.50. It was ok, but a bit light on the chicken which was disappointing so I would take a pass on that one.

I was invited back, and this time I enjoyed the chicken club, quinoa yoghurt-based salad and gluten free brownie. And of course how could I overlook the tea?! I decided to try a lovely decaffeinated tea: ""The Natural Beauty,""  and it did not disappoint. If I ever decide to give up coffee for good, this would definitely be my first stop for a modern tea shop. I nursed this cup throughout the day in fact, and it was quite sweet, pleasing to drink and flavourful, yes, even for a self-professed coffee addict. 

The sandwich, while still sparse on the fillings was a much better choice.
 
The quinoa salad was quite tasty and a satisfying accompaniment to the rest of my lunch. It kept well as take out, and I was able to eat the rest with my dinner which was an added bonus.

The brownie, while not as sweet as what I've become so accustomed to eating from most bakeries was delicious and did not leave me feeling like I had overdone it with the sugar. In the end, I much preferred it to the rot-your-teeth kind of brownie that I've ordered all too often at other bakeries. Although I'm certainly not gluten free and I'm reluctant to become so, I appreciated this one, and I'd recommend it to those watching their gluten intake or otherwise.

I did not eat ""in"" for either visit, although I enjoyed the environment of the quaint little tea shop. Too bad the tables and chairs weren't near the front, however, as I'm sure it would draw even more people if they could re-arrange their layout to appear more welcoming.

Both times I was served by the sweetest server and proprietors ever. While it never seemed to get too lined up at the counter, they were busy serving both restaurant patrons and counter guests at the same time. It was fun to look at all of the products while I waited, so it didn't feel as if I was standing there for long. 

So, altho the sandwiches are a bit pricier than one might expect, I'd venture to go for the salads, desserts and teas that they offer and you won't be disappointed. It's certainly the cutest bakery/deli shop around in the Sogra 'hood. I will just have to try the full tea service next time.",Positive,Good,Expensive
51,"Did we walk in with super high expectations? Definitely! 
Did we leave impressed? HELL YES. 

The restaurant itself is clean, simplistic, and modern looking with wide open booths and a communal bar. The menu, organized as a pamphlet, consists of neat lists of various appetizers, stir fried entrees, curries, and noodles. Service is attentive and welcoming with multiple waiters checking in on us without any of them uncomfortably hovering.

For our lunch, we ordered pad kee mao with prawns and rama thai, a peanut sauce stir fry, with chicken, both at medium spicy. It did take some time for our food to be prepared, but they both came out steaming hot and looked positively amazing. Firstly, the portions were huge and well worth the price. Secondly, the smell wafting from each dish made both of our stomachs rumble in anticipation.

We absolutely loved the pad kee mao. The noodles were soft, without being mushy, and there were so many perfectly cooked prawns strewn throughout. At first, I thought medium spicy would pack just a little kick of heat. THIS WAS BY NO MEANS LITTLE. The spice coated our mouths in a delicious fiery blanket that was both painful and addicting.

The peanut sauce stir fry, on the other hand, soothed our fiery taste buds with a creamy and savory palate. The chicken was prepared as bite size pieces and cooked to tender perfection. We even loved the side of fluffy, fragrant rice that was served alongside it. By the time we finished both dishes, we were ready to surrender to the impending food coma hanging over our heads. 

Thai Wok Kitchen certainly deserves its perfect Yelp rating. The food was delicious, the ambiance was welcoming, the service was friendly, and the prices can't be beat. Five stars easy!",Positive,Good,Cheap
52,"* Definitions *

This is a review update that reflects a ""new experience or interaction with the business.""

Let me tell you about my most recent personal experience and interaction with the owner of this restaurant in follow-up to my past personal experiences at the restaurant.

So I hadn't been to this place since my negative experience many years ago, and the absolutely awful health reports detailed in my last review. I crossed them off my list and didn't return.

Yesterday I received a note from the owner asking me to remove my review that said, ""for the past two years, we've been under a completely different management and we've cleaned up our act! We put absolute emphasis on clean hygiene and we've passed all our inspection reports with no problems...would you please kindly remove your review?""

So based upon my personal experience of interacting with the owner via yelp message, I decided I would consider revisiting and see how it has changed today. As I like my stomach, and keeping it healthy, I decided to verify the owner's claim that they've cleaned up their act entirely and check out the latest health reports.

I am glad I checked before heading in the door. According to the health inspection reports looks like there is still a bit of an issue: 5 critical infractions and 2 non-critical infractions on their latest inspection (February 2016). Some of the issues include:

- Food stored in a manner that promotes cross contamination
- Potentially hazardous food is not stored, displayed or transported at a temperature of 4C or below
- The premises is not maintained in a sanitary condition
- Equipment, utensils and/or food contact surfaces are not maintained in a sanitary condition
- Sanitation plan not developed
- Procedures in sanitation plan not followed
- Sanitizer levels are not being monitored and recorded
- The premises is free of pests: Not in compliance

So if this is the new owner's idea of cleaning up their act with absolutely emphasis on clean hygiene I suppose those pests are clean by regularly taking baths in the melted ice that should be keeping the food cold?

Suffice to say that my recent experience interacting with the owner who claims to have cleaned up their act, but clearly is still having issues with health inspectors, makes me question their definition of hygiene and I won't be putting their food into my body again. 

So I wrote back to the owner and let them know of my concern, and how I wouldn't feel safe putting his food in my body.  

The owner told me to look at the 2015 health review which was cleaner, and to skip the 2016 review that is more recent. Yes, the 2015 review was cleaner, but the 2016 review seems more appropriate to consider at this point, no?

In any case, my personal experience of being contacted by the owner, asking me to remove the review based upon my personal experience, me going through the personal experience of communicating directly with the owner and being nagged by him to remove my review, going through the personal experience of reading the latest health report, going through the personal experience of making screenshots of that latest health report, and my personal experience of being further nagged by the owner in private messages has led me to draw the conclusion that I still think this place is off my list.

Perhaps spending time sanitizing the restaurant instead of trying to sanitize the yelp reviews would be time better spent?",Positive,Bad,Undefined
53,"Warning:

***Do not bring elderly Chinese parents here.***

Deer Garden allows you to choose, based on an a la carte menu,  the soup base, noodle type, and the toppings.  You check off what you want on the menu.

***Do not bring elderly Chinese parents here.***

A la carte menus apparently confuse elderly Chinese people

***Do not bring elderly Chinese parents here.***

There are numerous choices of soup bases, numerous choices of noodles and numerous choices of toppings.  On top of that, they have a drink menu, and HK style food that is not noodle based as well as snacks, with certain time restrictions for certain items.  This will add to the confusion for elderly Chinese parents.  Information overload, I guess.

***Do not bring elderly Chinese parents here.***

The menu is in both Chinese and English.  Apparently, written Chinese is tough to comprehend for elderly Chinese parents even if they are schooled in Chinese.

***Do not bring elderly Chinese parents here.***

I ended up explaining the whole thing to them.  They still didn't quite get the idea.

***Do not bring elderly Chinese parents here.***

I end up ordering for them.  In fact, I told them what to get based on my knowledge of their preferences.

***Do not bring elderly Chinese parents here.***

You get a drink included with the  a la carte noodle dish.  A choice of HK style coffee or tea.

The drinks arrive first, but only one drink came.  Elderly dad complains to Yelper, ""Where are the other drinks?  Why did they not bring the other ones?""

Yelper reply, ""Dad, you do know this is a Chinese establishment, so the timing of items coming out will be inconsistent?""

Elderly Chinese parent, ""Harmmmmmmmphhhhh!""  He grumbles.

The rest of the drinks came within a minute.

***Do not bring elderly Chinese parents here.***

The snacks of fried wings and pork chops come first.  They were tasty.  Wings were really crispy.  3 wings for $1.75.  Sides cost $1.75 if you order a noodle dish.

Elderly Chinese parents approve.

The first round of noodles come and it just so happens that elderly Chinese dad didn't get his, since the bowls were too large to fit on the tray.  So the waitress walks away.  She happens to walk by a few seconds later and elderly Chinese dad complains to her, ""I'm missing my bowl??""

Yelper interjects, ""It's coming dad, stop complaining.""

Elderly Chinese dad: ""I'm not complaining.  I'm afraid they forgot my noodles""

Yelper:  ""Dad, when you're speaking to the waitress in less than one minute about a missing bowl of noodles, you're complaining.""

***Do not bring elderly Chinese parents here.***

Surely enough, the ""missing/forgotten"" noodles came within one minute.

***Do not bring elderly Chinese parents here.***

The noodles and soup were a hit all around.  Good flavours and a large quantity of food.  Nobody finished their food.  All of it was packed to go.  Elderly Chinese parents were happy because of bang for the buck.  Average bill was $10 per person with left-overs.

The place is modern and clean.  Men's room is a bit tight, so if you have elderly Chinese parents, heed warning, ""***Do not bring elderly Chinese parents here.***"", else they may complain about a tight washroom.

***Do not bring elderly Chinese parents here.***

I would come here again.

Elderly Chinese parents want to come again.

I'm not coming with them.

They'll have to fend for themselves.  Good luck to them with that.

***Do not bring elderly Chinese parents here.***

I'm not the only one who went through this experience according to one of my buddies.  Similar thing happened to him.

***Do not bring elderly Chinese parents here.***

You've been warned.

If you do bring elderly Chinese parents here, you didn't read my review.

- Avocado gimlet was incredibly refreshing, a delightful twist on a classic.
- Heirloom tomatoes with smoked ricotta and polenta croutons was delicious and hit the spot.
- Handmade pasta filled with chicken pesto came served in an umami chicken broth and soft poached egg, a light, palate-opener for sure. This is more of a consomme with a few pieces of pasta (vs. traditional pasta)
- Ling cod was outstanding, perfectly fried and paired with a lovely medley of summer vegetables
- Steak Diane was sadly the sole letdown, overcooked tenderloin that was cooked to medium, instead of medium rare. Actual beef quality did not blow us away, despite being plated beautifully, bland and over-peppered

The food sucks horribly though. I got the nachos which are made with thinly-sliced potato shavings (like baked potato chips) instead of tortilla chips. The whole thing was lukewarm and the toppings were stingy.

57,"If I could give this place no stars, I would.

Here are the snapshots.

To begin, the waitress kept asking our pregnant friend what alcohol she wanted.

Then after explaining to us that they served ""family style"" where everything was meant for sharing, we decided to order on our own, at which time, our waitress told us that because the kitchen was designed for family style, that she couldn't  guarantee that our food would arrive at the same time.  TOTAL cop out.  We said that was fine, and ordered anyway.

We ordered a fair bit of food, but since we were told that it would be family style, we expected to be able to have enough of each dish to be able to share.  Instead, this is what we received.

$32 for their Porcetta - we got a piece of meat about the size of 2 $2 coins surrounded by about 5 inches of hard, barely cooked fat surrounding it.

$9 for what they call spring rolls - which was essentially one single piece of lettuce wrapped in a piece of Japanese turnip.  The spring roll was about 3 cm long and there were only 2 of them.  So even cut in half, there wasn't even enough for 4 people to have a complete mouthful of what was essentially the simplest salad I have seen in a long time.

The croquettes tasted like pulled pork McNuggets.

The heirloom radishes hadn't been cleaned.

The halibut would have been wonderful, had there not been a very LONG strand of hair in it...

I could go on, but I already feel like I'm being cruel.

Granted, after we complained, they took off the ribs, the halibut and the porcetta,but our bill still came to over $180 before tip (so our bill would have been about $260 had we not complained) and we all left hungry, and ended up at another place to have an actual meal.

Thai Wok Kitchen stands out on Yelp because it's a 5-star restaurant in Vancouver, WA with over 300 reviews. Now that I've tried it, I can tell you that Thai Wok Kitchen is guilty of serving great food regardless of being Thai or Asian.

The friendly casual service matches the casual setting at Thai Wok Kitchen. Kudos to the team; however, it was the house-special Garlic Duck that seduced me. A lot of folks duck when it comes to eating duck, but not me when the dish is as flavorful and special as any duck I've tasted. Other fantastic finds were an addictive Cashew Nut Stir Fry, fresh Spring Rolls, and a satisfying Pad Thai.

60,"Eating at Cactus Club Cafe was like dining in a fire alarm: loud & annoying.

The restaurant is busy, but the service is not. The check-in and seating process was awkward ... and it was the best interaction we had the entire meal. Can you exchange your server for another one and not look like an a-hole? If so, please let me know how. I seriously wish we could of gotten a server that cared, came by, or was helpful instead of the bored and disappearing one we were assigned.

We started with a bottle of local Pinot Blanc (Mission Hill Family Estate (BC) Reserve). It was light and tasted like a chilled summer morning. The wine wasn't the best match for our food, but I'd get it again in the right setting (like a patio deck watching butterflies dance across a shallow stream). 

As an appetizer, we split a tempting Tuna Stack (4 stars - $17.75) with Ahi Tuna, Nori (seaweed), Sesame, Avocado, Cilantro, and Wonton Chips with a Citrus Tamari Vinaigrette. The avocado was fresher than the tuna and with a better sauce this might be more memorable.

My entree was the Blackened Creole Chicken (4 stars - $25) flavored by Cajun Spices & Creole Butter and served with Mashed Potatoes and Roasted Asparagus. I hoped for more spicy heat and much juicier chicken, but it was still satisfying and filling.

Olivia went with the Ravioli & Prawn Trio (3 stars - $14.75) that features three Butternut Squash and Mascarpone Ravioli topped by three Saut??ed Jumbo Prawns and Pine Nuts in a Truffle Butter Sauce. These went together like peas and chocolate. They didn't. 

The food was inconsistent and the service nonexistent, but there was one constant at Cactus Club Cafe: noise. It was so loud. I mean, IT WAS SO LOUD! We actually opted to not have dessert here because we wanted to head to a place with attentive service and a chance to relax.

La Ruota #2 finally opened up last week after months of delay & a recent nasty flood! 

""All things??come to those who wait"" as the saying goes - I guess. 

I've been to the original location on The High Street in Coquitlam a couple of times - located near Coquitlam Centre. 

Really enjoyed the authentic Neapolitan pizza there so I was glad when I saw signage go up advertising a new location here on 4th Ave @ Maple. 

Vancouver to Coquitlam can be an hours drive, depending on traffic so yes I'm mighty happy for this new location! 

Pizza is very subjective - there's a reason why Pizza Hut is still going strong decades latter - yikes! 

The way to approach pizza is simple by following this view - 'pizza is like sex, even when it's bad, it's still pretty good!' Hahaha! 

Now in regards to LRs pizza - I love it. 

But remember my taste will be 100% different from yours! 

Of note with this being a brand spanking new Pizzeria, the crew spoke with heavy Italian accents!

62,"Oh, Olive Garden!  Where to begin?  Well, the Salad and Breadsticks of corse.  They always come first!  They are also often the best part of the meal.   In fact, for me they are often the whole meal.

The bread sticks are kind of addicting,  I can't eat just one.  They are salty, buttery and garlicky bread, what is not to like?  The salad is iceberg lettuce,  black olives, onion slices, tomatoes and Peperoncinos in an Italian dressing.

Olive Garden is not real Italian food.  That is probably obvious but they have tried at times to claim they are.  They are a mass produced version of Italian American food that few, if any Italian Americans I know want to claim.

Still,  most dishes taste good,  by that I mean its nothing I find myself rushing back for but it isn't bad.

63,"On our recent visit to Vancouver, we chose to book accommodations here.  This hotel is conveniently located in downtown across the street from the Vancouver Lookout and a few blocks from the Waterfront train station.  Almost everything from coffee shops, restaurants and convenience stores are right down the street or walkable.  

Our taxi driver had a difficult time finding this hotel because there were no visible signs.  You have to pull up through an alleyway which is where the front entrance is located.  Upon arrival at the hotel, it was about 10pm so there was only one front desk clerk on duty.  The check in process was quick and simple.  She provided us with our key cards and we were on our way within 10 minutes.  The mobile key option is available which makes it easier.  

For the comfort and safety of hotel guests, you must swipe your room key in the elevator to select your floor.  The lobby has a sitting area where infused water and fresh fruit is served all day.  We didn't eat at any of the hotel restaurants so I'm not sure if they're good.  

The rooms here are all suites.  Our room was on the 22nd floor with the partial harbor view.  Very clean and spacious.  There's a separate living room and a bedroom.  The king sized bed was super comfortable.  The hospitality is amazing.  They had a hand written note and a dessert plate as a welcome greeting in our room.

We popped in for dinner and immediately discovered two things: 
 1. Smokehouse Provisions is popular and busy.
 2. Some of our friends had just sat down at table for four ... which quickly became a table for six thanks to a helpful server.

Then the parade of provisions began:

 * Bacon Molasses Cornbread ($3 - 4 stars)
Sweet Jesus, this bacon bread and sauce could be religious.

 * Cup of Chili ($5 - 3 stars)
Average Texas-style red chili hidden under a layer of cheddar cheese and onions

 * Sandwich Bread & Pickles ($9 - 1 star)
Even if this was complimentary, I'd pass on the this stomach-stuffer lacking flavor or distinction

 * Smoked Chicken with Potato Salad & BBQ Beans ($18 - 3 stars)
Despite being overcooked on the outside, the inside wasn't super tough; however, I'd still not try this again.

 * BBQ Ribs ($21 - 4 stars)
Pork spareribs were stuck to the bone more than I like and needed more sauce, but the meat was still smoky and tasty.

 * Beef Brisket (4 stars) & Pulled Pork (2 stars) Combination with BBQ Beans & Collard Greens ($18)
The Greens and Brisket were both standouts and quickly devoured. The pulled pork was off in flavor and texture.

 * Beef Brisket Sandwich with Fries ($10 - 3 stars)
The bun didn't match the beef in texture or quality so I skipped most of the bread. Even so, this is probably the best ""value"" on the menu.

We started the meal with a round of beers ... and ended with a round of whiskey plus the dessert of the day featuring berries and cream, but I don't remember its name. Even so, the nameless 4-star dessert was still pretty yummy.

an' Heathen Brewing has got some beauts. Find 'em all plus a few bonuses like burgers, brussel sprouts, and other beauties at Heathen Brewing's tap house and pub called Feral Public House in downtown Vancouver. 

Why is it called Feral? I don't know, but I'm guessing cause it's a bar full of feral ""wild beasts"" descended from domesticated individuals enjoying happy hour after work.

Any visit here starts and ends with beer ... just like so many nights in my household. The available brews on tap varies, but my preference, in order, are the Mega Dank Double IPA, Transgression IPA, Arson Amber Ale, Seins Belgian Tripel, RIP Porter, Transcend IPA, Son of Malice IPA, Promiscucous Blonde Ale, Dubhgall Dry Stout, Carnage IPA, and good ole local favorite Vantucky Pale Ale

The bar food at Feral Public House is better than your average PNW pub grub. I'm no fan of brussel sprouts, but the Bacon Me Brussels appetizer for $7 has Bacon and Brussel Sprouts drenched in a blend of Creamy Dijon and Garlic. Trust me, you've not had brussel sprouts like these. If you don't like them, sorry ... and keep drinking till you do.

For a spicy and juicy mix of meat and bread get a Volcano Burger on a Brioche Bun for $14. It brings a hint of heat with a mild Ghost Chili Aioli smoothed over by Smashed Avocado, Grilled Pineapple, and Onion Rings. This is one burger you and your taste buds won't have to be drunk to enjoy.

Yes, it looks so tempting.. I mean it has a small rotisserie chicken on a bed of rice in 1 of the pics shown on the sign; as well as, a tasty looking shawarma plate

I'm thinking maybe 20 mins later we got the food n his mouth tells me this Mixed Awsal (lamb n chicken skewed meat) that the meat was dry as hell n bland n that the lamb was a bit more juicy; whereas, the chicken had a little flavor 2 it 2 let u know even though it is an exhausted piece of meat that it still wanted 2 let u know it came from chicken

mouth continued 2 tell me since I can't taste as I am a stomach that the rice was nasty.. saffron could taste better but this was more to the sweet side as it featured raisin like things.. mouth was really upset when it got 2 that part telling me.. it said specifically, wat the f*ck hell is this?

mouth finally ended by saying salad was boring, but that Hidden Valley Ranch made each bite of lettuce a bit more interesting

the only highlight was the grilled roma tomato n the kids inside the restaurant being surprisingly quiet n behaving says Johnny n his mouth

We are truly living in the strangest of times & or rather in fact - one of the most bizzarest periods in my lifetime! 

One of the things I'm still getting used to is - paper straws! 

For the life of me it was bothering me for months as to why I kept biting down on these straws, mangling them up to the point were they become utterly useless.

I would end up having to keep asking for another straw. 

So frustrating ... I know FWP - First World Problems. LOL. 

I get why paper is better than plastic when it comes to straws & I actually supported that move. 

I'm sure you have seen the videos showing how much damage plastic straws do to the environment & especially the oceans & life living in it. Shocking!!! 

So here I was sipping my fav Bellini drink (using a paper straw) & chillin out on the patio at Cactus Club @ Coal Harbour. 

It was at this moment I realized - I've been so used to gently biting down on plastic straws for decades & expecting resistance back telling me to ease up on the bite! LOL. 

By the way has anyone tried using these paper straws in a 'Pea-Shooter' war!?? 

Remember those fun times growing up & being the kids that messed up McDonalds with paper bits all over the floor & walls!?

But, ... but ... there's something else ... and it may not be on the menu, but it should be on your order: a trio of whole Jalapeno Peppers grilled so simply it's elementary. Spice, Watson, spice! ... the game is afoot. Not a word! Into your mouth and ... yum!'

The bar is small at Little Conejo. The list of 80 mezcal is not. It's 100% smoky agave and 40% alcohol. Would you like to try it? For it is better to love mezcal late than never to love it at all.

We got no help when ordering at the counter or at the tables when asking questions on our first (and so far) only visit.

74,"Granville Island is a foodie wonderland and I've been told it can be insanely crowded on the weekends and later in the day.  So what's the best plan ... mornings.  That means coffee is needed badly before I even try to start talking with the great people of Granville market.

A lot of search came up with lacklustre options for coffee and Off the Tracks seemed like the best bet in Granville.  The cafe sits more in the lanes with the art studios and away from the chaotic crowds.  It's a bit more peaceful here.  There is a patio here for a few tables... when we were here, about half the patio tables were taken.  There is also a number of seating inside as well if you're wanting to keep out of the sun.  

The menu does offer more than coffee with a few baked treats and savoury options.  At the time I was there, it didn't seem too visually appetizing as most baked goods were pale.  For their espresso based drinks, they used the local roaster Elysian for their beans.

Flat White - This wasn't a flat white... more like a watery cappuccino.  It was unbalanced with the milk with a heightened acidity that made it nearly undrinkable.  It also had a lot of over frothed foam on top.  Watery and sour?  No thanks. 3/5

Perhaps there is another spot on Granville for coffee but this first attempt was not cutting it for me.  I would recommend you to give other spots if you're looking for a good coffee... or maybe bring coffee from off the island.  That's what I'm considering next time.",Positive,Good,Undefined

76,"Oh, no, it wasn't the BBQ. It was sucky service killed the feast.

I'm a lover of just about any All-You-Can Eat Korean BBQ, but average meat quality, small portions, weak sauces, and limited banchan means this restaurant is no monarch of the meat feasts; however, the colossal gorilla in the room as to why KingKong Korean BBQ was a giant failure was repeatedly forgetful service.

Even before ordering meats to grill, I ordered a draft beer. It didn't come. We ate our first round and I asked about the beer. Oh, yeah, was the quick response, but it wasn't followed by quick delivery of a frosty mug. So, after about another 20 minutes, I asked again. It took 55 minutes and 4 people to get me a beer. And, then I ordered another. Along the way, we had to order beef tongue, pork jowl, and King Kong steak multiple times ... and not because they were fantastic. No, because they seemed to keep forgetting. Sigh.

It would of (probably) been ok, if the meat quality, portions, and freshness was awesome. They weren't. Here's the meat and other dish rankings by my spouse and I:

Good
 * Thinly-sliced Beef Belly
 * King Kong Steak
 * Beef Tongue

OK
 * Thinly-sliced Beef Brisket 
 * Pork Neck Meat
 * Shrimp

Skip:
 * King Kong Marinated Beef
 * LA Style Short Rib
 * Beef Top Blade
 * Pork Jowl

Filler (to also skip):
 * Rice Cake
 * Butter Garlic Scallops
 * Corn Cheese

77,"I'm giving it a 4/5 for the day and time that I came. For those of you that are exclusively looking at my review only, I encourage you to look at others' Yelp reviews and you'll see a common theme: Unhappy employees, owner that refuses to let fresh coffee batches be brewed after 3-4 PM, high employee turnover, etc.

So the time I showed up to this Blenz Coffee was well before 3-4 PM, but because I had seen the other reviews I wanted to err on the side of caution. Rather than risk getting a spoiled batch of coffee, I opted instead for the Royal Tea Latte. Which, I guess in the United States, would be called a ""London Fog Latte"". 

It tastes better here than Starbucks. Way better. For starters, I watched the barista take fresh tea out of a glass jar to start the process, whereas at Starbucks they use some pre-packaged grounded-up crap to be the base flavor which in my opinion just doesn't taste as good.

The Royal Tea Latte was served all in under five minutes and I had it lidded on and out into lovely, rainy Vancouver weather in under an additional minute.

WiFi is okay at this place, I speedtest'ed around 5 Mbps which is sufficient for basic work but if I needed to do a video conference call while ""working from home"" I'd probably go elsewhere as I don't think 5 Mbps is enough bandwidth to carry a video stream especially if there are other guests present on their laptops too doing who-knows-what.

I probably spend more than $1000 for the food here already. All the dishes here are exceptional. The quality of their Pho comes very close to what you can find in Vietnam. The only thing missing in their bowl of Pho compared to real Vietnamese Pho is the taste of beef blood (Pho in Vietnam has plenty of beef blood in their broth). The portion of food here used to be pretty small, but the owner just increase the size of pho bowl recently. I would come back more often than ever. Shredded pork skin rolls are perfect. Chicken curry and shaken beef are above decent , however their sizes are still small.",Neutral,Moderate,Expensive
79,"* Sloppy second visit *

I visited again, and this time tried the free range crispy chicken sandwich ($13). The chicken was definitely the highlight of this. It was freshly fried, with a perfectly rendered skin with juicy meat inside the two large pieces. The lettuce was simple iceberg, and there were some nice pickles that were a step above typical fast food pickles. The sauce was generously applied (too generously if you ask me as it was making the lettuce and bun a bit gloopy) and had a strong spice kick to it. The bun was light and fluffy, while being slightly toasted. But the sauce was really too much and just dripped all over the place unnecessarily. 

Overall the chicken was the highlight, and I would actually prefer to get that without the lettuce - perhaps in a chicken tender format with a dipping sauce you can apply more delicately with the pickles on the side. 

I would order it again, but likely will ask for the sauce on the side.",Undefined,Undefined,Reasonable
80,"This place was OK, the service was nice but the food is seriously lacking in taste.

Came in one afternoon for a quick bite to eat. I ordered one of the beef pho noodle soup bowls and the shrimp salad spring roll. Food came out pretty fast but both items were seriously lacking in flavor. I had to dump an absurd amount of siracha and hossein sauce into the noodle bowl because there's absolutely no flavor in it whatsoever. Also there was very little beef in the bowl and way more noodle then I could possibly eat. I was also only given two small pieces of basil, and no mint at all. Then much much later I got the shrimp spring rolls, there was very little shrimp in them and a teeny tiny bit of greens but with a ton of the round rice noodles. The ingredients were seriously lacking and did not taste very good at all. In addition the peanut sauce came in a plastic container and you can tell it has been sitting there for a very very very long time because the liquid had already separated from the solid and I had to re stir The sauce and even then the top was liquidy and kind of gross looking. The flavor was also not very good.

Definitely do not recommend.",Positive,Moderate,Expensive
81,"***Beware***

Last month (Sept 28th) I had a horrible experience with Peaceful Restaurant's delivery service: the delivery driver demanded then harassed me for a ""good tip,"" even sinking so low as to add $10 to my bill on the debit machine without my permission; they screwed up my order; then, on top of it all, their lamian noodles were limp and overcooked. I tweeted about it and a bunch of my twitter friends responded with outrage. @peacefulresto tweeted at me to email them with details. Ameila Huang and I exchanged a few emails and she told me she would mail me a refund. Weeks have passed and nothing has come in the mail from them. Peaceful Restaurant is currently not answering my emails (Oct 15 & 20th) -- I wrote asking about the status of my refund. Plus they have now deleted the tweet they sent me in response to my twitter complaints so it doesn't show up on the restaurant's feed.

(*note: that the time we were corresponding, Amelia was signing emails with her name and her twitter handle was on Peaceful Restaurant's twitter as the social media manager.)

In our email exchange, Amelia Huang, Manager of Peaceful Restaurant (W4th) and family owner of all the Peaceful Restaurants, admitted to the bad service:

""I would like to sincerely apologise for your horrible experience last evening.??We do not condone the behaviour or actions of the delivery driver and is simply inexcusable.??We have a strict policy against asking for gratuities. I'm sorry that it was not made known to the driver sooner.""

She also admitted to the mix-up and poor quality noodles:

""regrettably, one of your dishes was indeed mixed-up with another bill.??As for the quality of the noodles themselves, I'm afraid given the distance of the trip it is very hard for lamian to remain that nice chewy consistency.""

This is what she wrote about refunding the meal:

""I would be more than happy to refund your meal, if you're also inclined??I would also like to??treat you to a proper meal??on us.""

Unfortunately, all this was lip service. Peaceful Restaurant is currently not answering my emails and has deleted their tweet to me off the @peacefulresto feed. 

This is how they have decided to deal with a deplorable customer service fail. Instead of rectifying the situation by being authentic and sincere, they only pretended they were resolving the issue with me. Their actual solution was to renege on their offer, cover it up, and then ignore me. WTF?! 

Seriously, Peaceful Restaurant? Is this how you run your business? Is this how you deal with poor customer service? Is this how you treat customers who pay for your food? You follow bad customer service with more bad customer service? 

DOUBLE FAIL!",Negative,Moderate,Undefined
82,"Maybe they read my review, considering that I didn't complain directly and that's a good thing! Although I despise the general lack of seating--which is also quite awkward--not to mention the uncomfortable stools here, the food is really great sans flies. I ordered a half sandwich (blt) and tomato soup that were awesome. Also tried the macarons (key lime, chocolate cookie , vanilla, passion fruit and chocolate) and one of their chocolate cookies which were all as divine and what I have been accustomed to from Hawksworth. Server was sweet and pleasant even if a tad slow, but not bad for a miserable Sat. in a tourist's mecca.

Since Hawksworth is the the best restaurant in the city, this place should not be far behind; they boast that it's also Hawksworth's creation after all, and it delivered. It's def. back on my roster of recommended breakfast/snack/ lunch establishments.",Negative,Good,Undefined
83,"I had wondered about this place for awhile but didn't think it served food. I was disappointed that there is no outdoor seating to enjoy on one of our sunny days, but apparently they are working on it. I was told that it was meant to be open by now. With Tap and Barrel just around the corner, they need to step their game up a bit here. 

The ""you can sit at the bar but not move to a table"" was annoying. I had never heard of this before. Why do all of these Albertan originated places have such bizarre seating policies that are quite the turn off? (Can we say Famoso pizza?) Nonetheless, the open space was great and it was absolutely packed on a Monday (long weekend) eve with a 20 minute wait for two people. 

The beer selection was wonderful of course, and surprisingly, so was the wine. In spite of the fact that it was so busy, the bartenders gave decent service and were both patient and  kind.  The beer flights (6 for $8 special) were a popular Monday night choice. They offer specials daily, in fact, so check the website for that. 

We shared the arugula prosciutto flatbread pizza ($11.99 special; regularly $15.) which was pretty average but not terrible. Also tried the hearty kale salad which was so dense and more than enough for two people, but it was also on the pricer side at $17. I even had some salad leftover that held up great for the next day. (I guess this is a benefit of kale?)

I made the mistake of using the ""unisex one person bathroom"" instead of the designated ones since it was the closest. The other ones were a trek across the restaurant and down the stairs, but they definitely would have been worth it. I'm not sure which sex to blame here, but it was worse than any bathroom that I'd seen in a NY dive bar. It was so bad that I was worried that I'd catch a disease in there and I didn't touch a thing. This really turned me off my entire experience.

If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands. Main Street's Charlie's Bistro had me doing the slow clap of appreciation for delectable dishes and a boy wonder bartender. 

Martini Tuesday and Happy Hour (3:00 - 6:00) aren't the only reasons to love Charlie's Bistro, but they are a strong start. An Elderfire Cocktail ($7) with Ghost Pepper infused Vodka and St. Germain Liqueur (Elderflower) was a diabolical drink of heat and sweet. Only try if you like spicy alcohol or want to up your game.

Wild Rice Corn Fritters ($5) were more fritter than wild. If you're looking for a stomach stuffer to go with your drinks, then this is the appetizer to share at Charlie's Bistro (3 stars)

A more intriguing small plate was the Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Walnuts ($6). Of course, brussel sprouts are the Damian Lillard of vegetables, so, order with a focus on the end game. Would you be surprised if I liked the walnuts more than the brussels sprouts? (4 stars)

Wild Mushroom Risotto ($16) with House Smoked Salmon ($5) was fishy fun thanks to Porcini Mushroom Stock, Onion, Arborio, Garlic, Olive Oil, and Parmesan Cheese with the attractive addition of Smoked Salmon. The flavors were strong like Lamarcus Aldridge going to the hoop from the left side. (4 stars)

For dessert, I was easily talked into the ?? with Vanilla Ice Cream ($7). No one ever NEEDS dessert. Everyone always WANTS dessert. Make this sweet and crunchy dessert the one you want. (4 stars)

85,"* New ""Neapolitan"" pizzeria *

This was a much anticipated opening, having been hyped by various food bloggers and professional food writers well before the much delayed opening.  

So it is finally open.  And it was packed.  Clearly their pre-opening PR helped them quite a bit.  

They are making a big deal out of using ""00"" Caputo flour and San Marzano tomatoes.  

We ordered the insalata mista, pizza margherita, and pizza diavola.

The salad had a nice variety including oven dried tomatoes, oven roasted garlic, shaved fennel, and standard greens.  It was a bit overdressed for my taste.  The oven roasted garlic was a nice touch, as was the fennel.  The oven dried tomatoes were over seasoned though.  Overall 3 stars.  Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/zaiO47nNPMgHJzK-8oOHjQ?select=uLW4xDn9GKSY-UdXRZaP-A

The two pizzas were identical in base toppings (pomodoro, parmigiano, fior di latte, basil) with the diavolo having the addition of salamino picante and chili pepper flakes.  

They also made a big deal out of the high temperature of their wood burning oven, which cooks at 900 degrees and each pizza only takes 90 seconds.  But amazingly both pizzas arrived lukewarm.  I like my pizza to be really hot.  This was not.  I'm not clear how they got so cool so quickly, but by the time they reached the table they simply weren't even close to being hot.  Boo.  

The crust had a nice char, but in the center they had captured steam under the crust because of the type of plate and it got extremely soggy.  Boo.  

I recognize that Neopolitan pizza frequently has a softer centre, but this was over the top steamed in the centre, not the classic Neopolitan softer centre.  Boo.  

The toppings were of decent quality, but nothing to blow your socks off.  The addition of a few very thin slices of salamino picante for the diavolo added 50% to the price raising it from $12 for the margherita to $18 for the diavola.  This seems a bit off considering the limited addition.  

Both pizzas were extremely difficult to cut (as many Neopolitan pizzas are since they eat by folding it normally), but this was not aided by the type of plate on top of a very slick table.  Poor choice.  They are going to end up with lots of broken glassware as people attempt to cut their pizzas (based upon my observations of a few tables almost knocking over their glassware while cutting) unless they figure out a way to make the plates stick to the table more.  

Here is a photo of the margherita:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/zaiO47nNPMgHJzK-8oOHjQ?select=egKPDPPAcdNevvdoere__w

and the diavola:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/zaiO47nNPMgHJzK-8oOHjQ?select=RYlMJwH-wIxViGd2nT0vxA

They also brought a bottle of rosemary olive oil to dip your crust into.  It had a nice flavour and rounded out the flavour of the crust.  Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/zaiO47nNPMgHJzK-8oOHjQ?select=4VXVjmRSeSX4kCH5YiYUlw

Overall I hate to say it but I give the pizza 2 stars.  I've had much better.  Sorry.  

Many spots even outside of Italy produce a much better pizza.  Sorry.  Vancouver still doesn't have a top notch Neopolitan pizzeria.  Sorry.

I can't see myself returning anytime soon, but likely this spot will become very popular because of their good PR skills.

Last tried the tasting menu and while personal preference had me--a self-professed, rich-food-junkie--begging for more veggies and greens (my only complaint here) the dishes were all amazing. 

Ordered: 
Maple Pickled Chefs Creek Oyster, shaved foie gras- the best there was and I'm not a huge oyster fan. Maybe my best ever? 

Confit bacon slab, micro riccolo, micro bulls blood, pomegranate, fried sprouts- delcious thick bacon. I would have preferred this at breakfast, though

Hickory smoked sablefish, lobster tortellini, applewood caviar, parsnip puree,-melt-in-your mouth divinity

Sous vide heritage angus short rib, marrow croquettes, baby carrots, truffle parmesan foam- I usually cringe at the thought of bone marrow; it's just not my thing. But I sure gobbled these up. More meat and more goodness!

Honey hazelnut semifreddo, bitter chocolate ganache-quite hard to break into; no matter. It meant we could savour it for longer if it didn't slide off the plate, first, that is.

The price: a Reasonable $80 per person. 

Also tried- a warm kale salad; quite heavy but delish. The poutine. To die for; also quite heavy. But if you order poutine, you ain't lookin' for light, after all. :) 

The nicest proprietor ever: Mike. He acts like he's known you for years, even if you've only met him once. Overall, I'd have to say this is Vancouver's BEST high end restaurant that manages to sell quality food in a warm and casual environment and at lower prices, It's still a relatively well-kept secret, too.

Vancouver is filled with lots of spots for inExpensive slices. But very few of them do a NY style slice.  I do really like the slices at Pizza Garden (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/pizza-garden-vancouver-3?hrid=r2bUOy87O1EhAntTZnZYDw) which are fairly typical NY slices.

Now the folks from Ragazzi (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/ragazzi-pizza-company-vancouver?hrid=rRhYjMEkcWrruyyEc6u2ug) have opened up this new spot downtown offering up their take on a NY slice - at a premium price point.  

I tried out the original and white slices from the display case.  They took both slices and heated them in the oven so they would be properly heated throughout. They oddly chose to serve the two large slices on a single plate by placing them on top of each other. That presentation could definitely be improved for the premium pricing.  

The original (tomato, fresh mozz, and basil for $3.25/slice) had a nice crust, good leoparding with proper chew. It was a well balanced slice, with just the right amount of each of the 3 primary ingredients. The white (mozz, smoked provolone, ricotta, grana, garlic, oregano for $4.00/slice) had a similarly properly done crust and good balance as well. The ricotta combined really well with the punch of garlic.

88,"Stopped into a ""buzzing""  little cafe to escape the showers today and was excited about finding a nice bowl of soup, or a decadent Valrhona chocolate cookie. Now I might have lost my voice, and I might be on my way to losing my hearing, but my eyesight is known to be like a cat's in the night. One quick glance at the display case and, sure enough, I notice a bunch of flies nestled nicely amongst the cookies, just as I have noticed the last two times that I attempted to eat here. (Notice how I say attempted.) It looked like some ""little guys"" had found a great place to hide in this abysmal weather. And good on them! 

I politely pointed this out to the server, and she looked a bit surprised if not embarrassed. I glanced again at the sandwiches and the what-were-no-longer-appealing bowls of soup and wondered just how many flies were nestled in there, too? Instantly, I lost my appetite and really wished that I had found Mom's earlier before she'd fled for the day. 

This has now been my my third time in the place; every single time, one quick glance under the glass case and I see the same little guys: fruit flies. 

 I began to wonder if everyone else's vision had been blurred by the rain? Or is it such a cute, hot spot that people just politely look away, merrily drink their lattes and continue their convos? What kind of bizarro world is this? This isn't a grungy little coffee shop; this shop adjoins one of Vancouver's finest restaurants, heritage hotels and top chefs. This is the casual version of where I once found my fave meal.

Plus there are mirrors on the ceiling so you can watch her on the sly. 

As for the food, it's bold. The portions are ample, the preparation flawless and the ingredients superb. You can do a close-your-eyes-and-point, and you'll strike pay dirt. We had the bison carpaccio (just don't think about the poor herd in GGP when you're chomping on it), the heirloom beet salad (with bright, anime looking veggies) and the most incredibly seared sablefish with fancy Japanese accompaniments. *eye roll to the back of my head* 

And of course, the drinks are phenomenal, creative and strong. The March 33 almost brought the boy to tears. The service is on point too.

Big Al's offers a family-friendly beer night while bowling or playing competitive games in the arcade. The place is almost always packed with people. It's really huge ... heck, so are some of the people. 

The layout at Big Al's is about 50% bowling, 25% arcade, and 25% sports bar. This works well for me cause a typical night here is 45% bowling, 5% finding a better bowling ball, 45% alcohol, and 5% air hockey.

Prices and specials vary by the day ... and by the hour. No matter what time we go, there always seems to have been a better time we should of gone. Happy Hour is 2:00 - 6:00 (M-F) and then late night 9:00 or 10:00 until close (depending on the day). There's also plenty of specials for juniors, seniors, military, and vets.

Fuse that all together and you've got Kurumucho.  It bills itself as ""Organic greens, vegetarian friendly, organic vegan desserts, Japanese taco shop.""  

That is a serious mouthful.  Unlike the actual portions served.

I ordered the ""Chicken Breast Karaage 'Zangi' Burrito"" ($9.95) which is described as having chicken karaage, organic brown rice, organic quinoa with 8 kinds of grain rice, grated daikon oroshi, organic avocado, spring mix lettuce, cilantro, tortilla chips with tonkatsu mayo sauce and sour cream.  Again, a serious mouthful of ingredients.  Unlike the actual portions served.

The little burrito served was rather one noted flavour wise. I would not taste any oroshi or cilantro. Couldn't find any tortilla chips mixed in, and the karaage was more of a stir-fried chicken taste than karaage - it had no crunch at all in fact.  The quinoa and brown rice were a major flavour component - a fairly bland one. There was a very thin slice of avocado.

Overall this was not a particularly satisfying fusion burrito.  It was a fairly bland tasting, non-filling, snack.

They also have a selection of tacos priced between $5.95 and $6.95 for a single taco.  Yup.  You read that right.  For a single taco - which I have to assume is smaller than the fairly small burrito.

Overall this one is a pass for me with its bland tasting small portions.",Positive,Good,Undefined

Mi Mary's Trattoria (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/mi-marys-trattoria-vancouver) closed, and has now re-opened as Mi Mary's Noodle and Liquor Bar.  They changed their signage, got rid of all the non-Chinese stuff from the menu, and have focused primarily on the various types of noodles they make in-house.  

First impression:  disposable plastic table cloths that you can take off the top layer, paper cups for water, food served at a table but on a cafeteria tray!  Um.....Ok.  

Got the menu from the VERY friendly waitress who then sat down next to me as I was ordering.  

I ordered the seafood, mushroom, and vegetable latiao ($12.95 for a small size).  It took a long while for them to be prepared as they were making it all pretty much from scratch back in the kitchen. 

The dish looked like it had a lot of different things in it on first glance.  (Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/mi-marys-noodle-and-liquor-bar-vancouver-2?select=lXEMh1KojDhDqE3qxT5NRQ)  There were several shrimp that were nicely prepared, a single piece of white fish that had a bit of an iodine taste but otherwise was fresh, fresh spinach, tomatoes, green onions, and a ton of celery.  The sauce was a mixture of chili, black bean, cilantro, and a TON of garlic.  The garlic was undercooked so it tasted pretty much like munching on a clove of raw garlic.  Overall the sauce was really not particularly well balanced.  The noodles were the biggest letdown though.  They were prepared fresh, but not well.  Some were overly thick and still had almost raw flour inside of them, while others were fairly thin and slightly overcooked.  These were not good noodles by any stretch of the imagination unfortunately.   

Overall since they have relaunched as a noodle bar I do feel they should be doing a much better job on their noodles.  Kudos for the friendly service, but the sauce and noodles are not good enough to make me return anytime soon even if the service is friendly.",Negative,Undefined,Reasonable

The buffet offered multiple meat and vegetarian options, pakora and solid naan. I like to spread a thin layer of rice across the plate and do small sections of each saucy dish to create the ultimate plate. The usuals like masala, biryani and paneer were all very tasty and the naan was hot and fresh.

I had heard lots about the chain before much if it good,  though from suspect sources.  

To be fair I can see what they like, because I know several people who would be fans.  There are lots of these kinds of places for a reason.  Here it is:  they serve huge portions at typical or slightly less the typical prices.

My biscuit was huge a small loaf of bread really,  but rather then a biscuits lecture and taste it was more like eating white bread.  There was none of the flaky biscuit texture.... All the food was kind of like that.  It lacked quality but there was enough of it in one meal to feed me for a day.    My friend, a fan of chicken fried steak, took I think two bites and was done.

The staff was nice, even if service was slow.

Will I be back?  Not if I am choosing.   I would if I was with someone who really wanted to but I am far from a fan,  I like restaurants with better flavor.

R. Kelly and my trainer would surely forgive me for leaving my nearby gym after a strenuous workout ... and heading directly here for a Five Guys Double Cheeseburger and huge order of Cajun Fries. Sometimes, you've got to give in to your urges ... especially when it is a diet-killing fast food burger with unlimited toppings.

My recommendations:
 * Don't be shy about doubling a topping ... like Jalapenos
 * A regular Cheeseburger here is a double
 * Get a ""little"" if you just want one beef patty
 * Grilled Mushrooms & A1 Sauce for a Steakhouse Burger
 * Skip the stale peanuts and save room for the fries
 * Cajun Fries are good ... Regular Fries are better
 * A ""small"" order of Fries is way too many ... share

This Five Guys location was slower than any I've seen (slow night and slow service). The burger and fries were classic Five Guys, but the burger builder was off his game. It took multiple attempts to get my burger and my wife's burger right. They kept mixing up the two list of toppings with parts from each list. Not sure how that happens, but it added 25 minutes of waiting on top of the original 10 minute wait.

This spot has turned over again and the new restaurant is called Dewan-E-Khass.  They have put up new signage and made the interior quite welcoming. It feels less hole-in-the-wall than previous restaurants in the spot have felt.

The menu has a mixture of Pakistani and Indian cuisine. I ordered the lunch special vegetable biryani ($7.99) which came with a complimentary side of raita.  The spicing on the biryani was spot on.  The complex seasoning profile highlighted the vegetables mixed in nicely with a very pleasant level of heat.  The veggies were cooked perfectly so that they had a slight chew to them instead of just being mushy.  The complimentary raita served to cool the spice level and the small bits of vegetables in the raita added nice texture as well.  Overall a lovely lunch for a very Reasonable price.

Our last experience they charged us differently than what the menu stated, so I questioned.  They did not respond appropriately at first, but inevitably they adjusted the price correctly and apologized that it was apparently an old menu.

Round two featured mule-like cocktails including a London Mule ($9 - with Gin and hints of Elderflower) and a Gincindental Contact ($8 - Bombay Dry Gin, Canton Ginger Liqueur, and Ginger Beer). My favorite of the four was the Gincindental Contact. 

Before moving on to a dessert of Loowit Shadow Shinobi IPA ($6.50) on draft, we split an appetizer of Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Bacon and Fried Egg ($10) and a medium-rare half-pound Garlic Gorgonzola Burger ($15) on a Brioche Bun. The food was even better than the drinks.

104,"Fine Dining in a Park - Part Two

Teahouse is located in the Ferguson Point area of the World famous Stanley Park.  This is actually one of the more serene areas in the park, away from most tour buses and large crowds.  It is also near the Ferguson Point entry point of the Vancouver Seawall so you have no excuse not to take a beautiful walk after a hearty meal to burn off some calories.

This restaurant is owned and operated by the Sequoia Company of Restaurants, which is the same parent company of Seasons in the Park (please see Part One).  So after a very positive experience at Seasons, we have to give Teahouse a go.

KASSLER PORK AND APPLE SAUSAGE BENEDICT:  This is on the brunch menu available on weekends only.

Kassler pork is a salt-cured pork loin which is a leaner cut than Canadian bacon. The texture of the meat was excellent as it was typically less processed than ham or bacon. It had a slight to moderate smoke flavor which was more on the subtle side.

The apple sausage tasted like it was pork based and was slightly sweet with apple and some other (maple, maybe?) flavors. The sausage skin was paper-thin (nice!) and you could really bite into it to create a burst of yumminess.

The eggs were nicely poached with the whites completely cooked and the yolk warm and liquidy. The Hollandaise sauce was rich and delicious. The final touches of the Benny were fresh baby asparagus and saut??ed baby white rose and purple potatoes.  This was truly a memorable dish as every component was perfectly executed.

TEAHOUSE STUFFED MUSHROOMS:  The mushrooms were stuffed with a mixture of shrimp and crab meats and topped with a very generous portion of cream cheese - in fact, a bit too generous as we felt that there were too much cheese (a bit overwhelming) and not enough meat.  The stuffing itself was a bit bland and with a fishiness taste. The final touches were garnishes of fresh arugula leaves sprinkled on top of the dish.

105,"4.5 stars ... so utterly close to my perfect diner.  It was one of my favourite spots to eat while visiting Vancouver.

Oh Fable diner... you were the last tastes I had and what a way to leave the city on that note.  I heard that this place was popular on a weekend morning but I had no idea how crazy busy it would be until I popped in and lined up BEFORE it opened.  A line up of 12 people (at least) formed 10 minutes before opening and after going, I can see why.

The place itself is big and open ... an upscale and warm diner is a good description.  Casual but still a lot of nice touches to let you feel that this is not your regular mom and pop operations.  Though I was worried about the service, they had so many people working that it was always a warm friendly hustle getting the plates out and taking orders... filling up coffee mugs. 

The seating is a bit cozy.  We heard everyone's conversation but turns out that was actually a nice thing this time around.  We had a lot of nice conversation with the neighbouring tables about the Vancouver food scene.  Anyhow, service here is what you'd expect out of a diner... just super friendly and warm.  FAST... did I say fast?  We ordered and got our meals in about 10 minutes.

Hash & eggs with beef brisket - Topped with 2 perfectly orange yolked sunny side eggs, the hash underneath was plentiful with onions, peppers, mushrooms, cheddar, and jalepeno.  I do have to admit the addition of the beef brisket sounded good but the portion was very very small for $6.  It was about a small take out sauce container of beef brisket.  I say stick to the flavourful hash that is done well and save the $6 for bacon or sausage if you want more meat.  3.5/5

Avocado smoked mushroom Bennie on cheddar chive scones - GET THIS.  I don't know why more places use scones... this was far better than any english muffin one I've ever had.  It buttery, tender with the right crags and crack to take in more of the egg yolk and hollandaise AND they added cheddar and chives as if it didnt have enough flavour.  Anyhow, I made mine vegan... smoked mushrooms were nice and savoury while the avocado was creamy.  5/5

Overall, I really think this was a good spot for a casual breakfast. I loved my bennie and i normally am not a fan (dont like English muffins) so the fact I can come out raving about it... It's just a good spot I'd be happy to come back to.",Negative,Moderate,Expensive
106,"Why is it that every time I visit GI (which is often) everything looks ""delish"" and I suddenly become a tourist? And why it is that shortly afterwards, I always regret my choice? 

I noticed that the Asian-Polish perogy place had closed, and I was secretly relieved as they could never quite deliver that authenticity (and who could blame them)?  Then I found Kaisereck. Wearing my ""tourist"" blinders, I ordered a perogy platter hoping for some authenticity here. Nope; not even close. 

My heart dropped a bit when I saw my server count out a tiny amount of perogies, and half of them were broken. It's not too difficult to keep perogies ""whole"" when boiled properly, much like preventing pasta from sticking together when boiling. But I could tell that I was dealing with amateurs here, and no one resembled anyone from any side of the Eastern bloc. Too bad for me.

I asked for extra onions, and of course their requisite ""watered down"" sour cream and then requested some pepper as there was none to be found. I tried a few different types of mustards for the sausage and even added some ""hidden"" bacon. So $12+ dollars later, I was ready to share my plate.

By the time we found a seat anywhere at all (outside; free of bird crap) our food was cool. The sausage was rubbery and overcooked--not with a nice char, but boiled--so much so that it didn't seem to make a difference what the temp of the food rested at. The perogies were okay, but I think that I would have enjoyed the sour cream, sauerkraut, onions and bacon just as much mixed together on their own.

The meal seemed to match the cloudy skies of the day.

108,"Patisserie Lebeau fulfills the common Yelp catchphrase of ""serving something different."" It's a small patisserie in the Armoury District of Vancouver that specializes in pre-made (yes pre-made) Belgian waffles with a series of toppings and fillings that range from custards and savory meats within to fruits, nuts, and chocolates on top. All of this sounds like a good idea in theory, but I'm not quite sure it works in execution.

The waffle is Belgium's most famous export, divided into broad regional subcategories that have existed for hundreds of years: the Brussels waffle (gaufre molle) and the Li??ge waffle (gaufre au sucre). What's the difference? Li??ge waffles are made with a yeast-based brioche dough and include pearls of sugar that crystalize on the waffle iron. The sugar hardens during the cooking process so they're chewy on the inside and have a crisp, caramelized outside layer, much like cr??me br??l??e. Size-wise they're normally smaller and rounder than the Brussels waffle, which has a larger, rectangular shape. The light batter-based delight you have in the comfort of your home or in the barely wiped booths of your neighborhood IHOP covered with 5 pounds of whipped cream, powdered sugar, and fruits somewhat resembles the Brussels waffle. Lebeau sells both with the aforementioned toppings and fillings.

Speaking of neighborhoods, Patisserie Lebeau is located in what I can only describe as Exotic Car Row. Your view from inside is a McLaren dealership across the street, and you'll pass Bugatti, Maserati, Ferrari, and Lamborghini dealers on your way to the front door. As such I expected flawless artisanal pastries providing sweet sustenance to those who are in the area to drop half a million on a car.

What I got instead were two sad waffles for a total of $4.22 USD. The Li??ge waffles I ordered were displayed in a case of pastries made that morning. Typically enjoyed as a dessert or snack (rather than a breakfast food) in their native Belgium, good Li??ge waffles are often tasty even at room temperature since they're brioche-like and full of glorious fat. As such the waffles were rich as expected but they were also, sadly, dry and lacking any texture on account of the cooled chocolate stuck to the tops, which essentially suppressed the sugary crispy exterior you normally enjoy with these. Thus both the dark chocolate orange and ruby chocolate varieties I tried were a disappointing mouthful, basically a dessert of wasted calories and bad first impressions.

For me, this entire concept would work better if the food was made to-order, but business seems to be prospering and other Yelpers primarily rave about the place, so I'll just file 'cold waffles' into the 'not my thing' category and call it a day. I've enjoyed waffles off the backs of trucks or from stands in the middle of the street a lot more, including in Brussels and Bruges, where there's pride in serving these puppies HOT.

With all of that said, while Lebeau specializes in Belgian pastries, there's more to the place than just waffles, and I'd return to give some of their other cakes and delicacies a try--next time I'm in the neighborhood Bugatti-shopping.",Positive,Good,Expensive

Alright, one beer ... 

It was Friday night and, like so many others before it, the war of wills between dieting and drinking was being waged in my mind. I know, I know ... it's a silly amusement that always ends the same way, but, on this Friday, the mental gymnastics came to an abrupt end when my wife, my sweet lovely wife, said she wanted a beer ... just one little pint at Final Draft Taphouse on Mill Plain.

2 hours later ...

My liver was suddenly on a first name basis with the taptender (or is it beerista?) because at Final Draft Taphouse, there are 30 regional beers and ciders on tap. Picking one is hard. Sticking to just ""one"" is impossible.

Of course, one beer became two. It inevitably does ... when faced with the Shakespearean dilemma of ""two beer or not two beer, that is the question."" ... We all know the answer ... and followup poll of ""3 beer or 6"" ... You can do the math. 

Along the way, we split some surprising pub grub and one regrettable panino. I'd easily get the simple, but satisfying Meat and Cheese plate with Salami, Duck, and Homemade Jerky plus Smoked Gouda, a Goat Spread, and young Manchego again. An addictive Romaine Wedge Salad was memorable; however, I hope I remember to pass on the Pastrami Panino next time. Anyways, we were here for just a beer, right?

As the dinner crowd came and went, my appreciation for local IPAs grew while my sobriety shrank ... thanks to a steady flow including Mass Ascension IPA (6.5% abv / 80 ibu) from Ex Novo (Portland, OR), Wild Fire IPA (7.5% abv / 72 ibu) from Barrel Mountain (Battle Grouind, WA), Fields of Green IPA (7,5% abv / ?? ibu) from Fort George (Astoria, OR), and Trickster IPA (6.9% abv / 68 ibu) from Black Raven (Woodinville, WA).

..so we have been coming here ever since

here r some facts b4 I lead u in2 our review:
(1) Korean Fried Chicken or KFC is a new thing going on in America;
(2) Hooters n Wingstop or any other fried chicken including my other favorites like WinCo Foods employee owned don't even come close;
(3) Their drumsticks r perfectly uniformed w/ consistency.. I think I posted a pic on here, but since it been so long, it's not going 2 connect w/ this review;
(4) U know u found a gem, when u go in a restaurant n it is for example: a Chinese restaurant n all Chinese r eating there.. this 1 had mainly Koreans;
(5) Theirs hit it in all lvls: flavor, texture, moistness, all notes n any other wing or fried chicken don't even come close 2

which leads us 2 the actual review..

Poor Italian?  Cutesy sounding name.  It draws up images of hearty peasant style Italian food.  Too bad the name was true - but in a different way - it just meant a poor attempt at Italian fine dining.  Oy......

Chef Gianni Picchi, formerly of Il Giardino, heads the kitchen here which is being advertised as Italian fine dining featuring items such as fresh housemade pasta.  Lovely.  Vancouver could use some more high quality Italian fine dining ala the Bay Area.  

Service was friendly, but I personally saw at least 5 miscommunications/misfirings just watching during my meal.  Everything from wrong orders being brought to a table, to timing of items such as bread and pepper being off, to frequent requests for water refills that hadn't been noticed, etc., etc.  The service is definitely not at fine dining calibre, although the prices are in the lower range of fine dining (about $8-$15 for most apps, $14-$18 for pastas, and $20-$30 for mains).  That is a bad mismatch.

I was excited about the fresh housemade pasta, and wanted to confirm before ordering.  My waitress assured me that all pasta was made fresh in-house.  Great.  

They brought a bread basket to start, which had 3 types of bread.  The focaccia was not as fluffy as I would like, and perhaps just a bit past its freshest.  The bread sticks tasted like the commercial packaged ones you can get at the grocery store, and the Italian bread was severely underbaked.  There was not crunchy crust to speak of.  It came with a low quality soft smooth butter instead of either a high quality butter or a nice olive oil/balsamic plate, etc.  Not impressed.  

I started off with the ministrone soup.  It had a nice selection of fresh diced veggies, some fresh spinach leaves, but the two types of beans tasted like the overly salty canned variety.  The pasta in the soup was definitely NOT fresh housemade.  It was clearly dried pasta.  I started to get worried about my main, but figured perhaps they just cut corners on the soup, bread, and butter.  

I got my rigatoni, which had a sauce composed of sundried tomatoes, sausage, and peas.  The sauce was extremely underseasoned, which was surprising considering it had sundried tomatoes and sausage which both normally add quite a flavour punch.  There was a hint of citrus in the sausage - which was nice.  The peas tasted like frozen though instead of fresh.  And the big disappointment was the pasta.  This was standard dried pasta - and not even one of the better quality ones.  There is no way this was fresh housemade.  A manager came around asking how the meal was, and I asked about the pasta.  She said, ""Oh it is dried. We make most of our pasta, but not that one.""  Um...Hello?  False marketing?  False guidance from the initial server?  Hello?!?!?!?!  WTF?!?!?!?!?!

Overall I should have trusted the name.  They offer poor Italian ""fine"" dining.  

Meals like this remind me that 95% of fine dining is just overhyped.  I love an amazing fine dining meal with the best of them, and am happy to pay for it.  What I can't stand is restaurants that charge fine dining prices (even at the lower range of fine dining prices), but deliver quality well below.  Oy......Give me a quality hole-in-the-wall anyday!",Neutral,Moderate,Expensive
116,"I'm finally able to lift my head off the pillow for the first time since Friday night to write my disappointing review of this restaurant. I'm not going to blame them for my food poisoning; after all, my friend ate here too--but this is the worst Thai I've ever eaten in Vancouver--other than the Thai house, another restaurant in their chain.

We ordered some awful deep fried appies that tasted like they were from Safeway's frozen food section, followed by the Pad Thai. It WAS made with ketchup--not tamarind--contrary to what the menu might have told us. The noodles used were vermicelli noodles and not the traditional pad thai noodles. There was no flavour to the entire dish. If Bob's ""new"" Thai place makes a 3 and Aree is around a 4.5, this place is a 1.5-2 at best. As a point of reference, I find the medium spice at Aree quite spicy; others might see ""medium"" as medium. This was completely and utterly bland to someone who recognizes very little spice. So disappointing and not good at all, to say the least. 

I asked the waitress if they actually used tamarind. She replied with a meek, unenthusiastic, ""yes"" and brought me an old crusty dish of hot sauce as if to say, ""add your own spice"". Great. Whatever happened to being able to request any level of spice in a Thai place? duh. 

I can appreciate the wine selection and their attempt at a hip, modern decor. I didn't even stay long enough to visit the bathroom. (I had plenty of time for that later when I was so incredibly sick--but that's another story). The waitstaff was fine as was the wine, otherwise this would have earned even less than a 2 star. But on a Friday night, when we left around 8:30 pm, we were almost the only patrons in the place. Unless it's packed at lunch, I'm not sure if it will be around too long. 

I can appreciate that some people enjoy this chain, but since it's surrounded by so many other ""passable"" restaurants, they have to be able to compete. I appreciate that they've tried to emulate ""Peep"" or the Spice chain in NYC, which are restaurants found all over the city there and are a dime a dozen, really. A quick glance on the NY Yelp indicates that even NY'ers rate those places around a three, when they are at least a 4.5 in comparison to PE. But this place doesn't quite cut it, all in all. 

I also appreciate the 4 star reviews, since if an Elite party is held here, I could see how the ""perks"" would outdo the actual ""taste."" But I would not recommend, I will not be visiting again, and I probably won't be able to eat any Thai at all in awhile, sadly.",Negative,Good,Undefined
117,"This place is well worth the wait!  And while you wait, you're given hor d'oeurves and chai, while Vij himself walks around saying hello!  If you find that having a drink and noshing on snacks won't keep you satiated while waiting, Vij's more casual concept, Rangoli, is right next door!

The wine list has plenty of reasonably marked up wines that pair quite well with the menu, and the food is delicious.  Also, the service staff we interacted with were warm and gracious.

118,"It was a busy Sat. and altho we didn't have a reso, we were given the booth which was a great place to sit. Our impression was positive from the start. 
We tried a few different entrees including the smoked salmon and braised pork which were a bit on the average side but still good; the real winners of the night were the mushroom and gruyere tarts and they were so tasty that a second was ordered at our table.
Also ordered the apple crisp with caramel sauce and the chocolate raspberry mousse  desserts which were pretty standard but absolutely delicious. 
The sommelier and his pleasant treatment made the place worthwhile. Altho service was a tad slow and the whole ""French"" theme is a bit done, it's certainly a welcome change to the 'hood. I'd definitely return when wanting to try something new, if for nothing else than the wine and tarts, of course.",Positive,Good,Reasonable
119,"I feel bad that I had to write this 1 star review of the restaurant, I am hoping this will bring to their attention of customer service and treatment of their customers. 

I came to know of this restaurant through a Groupon promotion of $16.95 for 2. 
So I organized a group of coworkers to go on a Sunday night for their buffet, I have called in advance and was told, by a fairly impolite manager (he sounded frustrated and this is probably not the first time he had to answer this question), that No, we can only use one groupon ($16.95 for 2 people) at a table/bill, we can NOT sit together as a group of 20, even though they are a self-serve buffet establishment and they have large tables (seating capacity was 200 here). 

With that information, I let everyone know,  (I was just planning to go try it out with my SO), and we all went ahead and bought 10 separate Groupons and agreed to sit separately because we plan to hangout together afterwards anyway. 

(I ended up giving my Groupon pass to another 2 coworkers for Sunday night), but this is what happaned: 

The manager refused to let them in! He insisted on that we cannot use our deals even though we bought separate Groupons and are willing to sit separately. His attitude was so bad that though a few of the ppl in the group was willing to just pay the regular fare to sit down and eat, most of the group were so offended by his attitude that they decided to go else where. 

====
word of advise to the management team:

If you strike a bad deal with Groupon or is losing money over the deals sold, don't take it out on the customers because you will not help your restaurant image. Please deal with your Groupon representative directly to resolve the issue. Keep in mind that in North America, a retail business relies heavily on it's reputation and treatment of the customers.",Negative,Good,Cheap
120,"Mali Thai has been my go-to lazy person dinner for the past year. It's never really been that great (hence the no review until now) but like, they offer free delivery on orders over 20$ and the Tom Kah is usually a pretty decent hangover food. 

But then today happened: 

- A curry made of frozen vegetables (save for the cabbage?) in a thick, gooey, entirely inedible sauce. 
- A murky Tom Kah Gai that tasted as though it'd been scooped from the dredges of the bottom of the day's batch. 
- An overly sweet (as in, 'sipping on liquid cotton candy mixed with coconut milk' kind of sweet) green curry. 

The whole meal was so obscenely bad that my boyfriend, the guy who eats anything and everything - even when it's pretty terrible - THREW OUT an entire dish full of food.

What's worse is that? I called Mali Thai to let them know that the food was abnormally bunk, and the manager argued with me. Argued over what? ""The dishes were as they always are."" Well then sir, you're admitting that your dishes have always been *that* offensively inedible. Not an apology, not an offer for a curry on the house next time - not one reason for me to ever go back.

First time was just alright, I can tell he didn't really do a good job on the inside, wasn't quite clean in the corners and cupholders. I still tipped him $20 out of generosity.  Then, I tried to make an appointment with my second voucher 2 weeks before it expired. 

This is where the fun began, I called the night before, the guy told me to call back the next day as he didn't have his schedule. Call back next day, gave him my name and informed him I had another voucher. He said according to ""HIS"" list, I had only purchased 1 voucher and already used it. So I went home and got the 2nd voucher #, called him back and he STILL insists that he didn't have any record of me purchasing 2 vouchers. So I double checked my socialshopper account AND checked my visa statement from back in January when I had purchased it, definitely bought 2. So I told him I can bring it in and he can call Socialshopper himself. He then proceeded to tell me to call them as he ""doesn't have time to deal with them"". He also told me I can still have it done but he will charge me full price. Why would I want to do that. After 15 minutes of trying to reason with the dude, he obviously thinks he  is right.

The soup base itself was nice and flavorful, good combination of spices. As for the prices they were a little higher than other noodle places which is why I didn't bother with anything else. The service was awful and I was more treated like un inconvenience for my presence due to culture, another reason I didn't want to stay long.

C'mon, is it really too much to ask for some properly-textured noodles in a 'noodle bar'? But what bothered me most is the soup base: it's spicy (even if you specify mild) and nothing else. No flavour, no depth. What you do get is a garlic aftertaste that'll last you for the better half of the day.

An order of Wild Tiger Wings was a reliable starter to share before my order of Drunken Noodles with Tofu arrived. 

I asked for the noodles to be extra spicy, but they were tame. The same could be said for the other food because nothing stood out as absolutely wild and nothing royally sucked either.

The infamous Max's of the Philippines opened here in Vancouver earlier this year, and I've been meaning to try it out.  I finally got around to it.

Walking in the space is large, bright, and not well kept.  About half of the tables were full with guests and the other half had piles of dirty plates waiting to be cleaned.  This was kind of odd as there were about 5 staff members all standing around chatting towards the front instead of cleaning the tables.  Mind you, this was BEFORE the lunch rush.  So perhaps 5 free staff members is short staffed (considering their need to chat with each other) and they are unable to clean up the tables?  Hm.....

Eventually one of them greeted me and brought me to a dirty table, which they then cleaned up.  Thankfully the bursts of cleaner that sprayed onto me along with the table were short.  Hm.....

I ordered the signature chicken in the version of a half chicken dinner plate.  The waitress taking the order was short (verbally) during the process.  

After a short wait, the included corn soup arrived.  It was rather short of flavour and fillings.  Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/2w2JBXIUgGzaMLXkmpXAtg?select=oe7YjRUG1bXIsELD3nlw0w#oe7YjRUG1bXIsELD3nlw0w

Next came my plate which had a half a fried chicken, some fries, and a caramel bar.  The chicken had a nice crunchy skin, but it was a bit short on seasoning.  The meat on the lower half was moist, but the breast meat was very very dry.

The chicken really needed the sauces.  Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/2w2JBXIUgGzaMLXkmpXAtg?select=CzxHrDMEGhHreoKBMItF_g#CzxHrDMEGhHreoKBMItF_g  Overall the plate was short on flavour.

I had a hard time getting the chatting staff to refill my water, and eventually just had to help myself from the server stand.  Yes, you guessed it, they were short on service.  

Getting the bill however was quite easy.  I didn't have to ask for it.  While I was still in the middle of my chicken dinner, the waitress slapped the bill onto my table, and I had to stop her from removing my plate which still had an entire chicken breast on it.  It wasn't as if I had stopped eating.  I was chewing and holding a piece of chicken in my hand!  Sheesh.  Clearly she wanted me to shorten my stay and leave.  

I looked around and there were plenty of empty tables (waiting to be cleaned off of course), and only one party of people waiting up front for the chatting staff to seat, so I wasn't clear why the rush.

After I finished my meal I tried to pay, and the waitress short-changed me!  Sheesh.  Not acceptable.

I needed my Ramen fix in Vancouver! And despite all the negative reviews from this place I decided to give it a try. I am so happy I did! A delicious ramen joint right in the hustle and bustle of Granville, this place is getting great attraction here! 

If you have ever heard of the saying, ""don't judge a book by its cover"", this place definitely fits the script. Jinga Ramen Bar has recently been renovated and opened up April 21st 2017, and I have to admit that whatever happened before this bar is definitely not happening now; they have stepped up their game , extended their menu, and sex'd there frame up! The d??cor is everythin' here! Includes dark wood and brick and presents as a bar/lounge and restaurant, all in one! 

I love the new spot! It's now in a larger venue from what they used to be in and offers:  a wonderful bar smack in the center of the room offering 12 stool seats at the bar, a spacious dining area, a small 5 seater ramen bar area and a lovely outside patio area! 
After some nightlife in Granville, I decided to slurp down some ramen and came across this sexy restaurant! After checking out their menu and seeing what they had to offer, I didn't hesitate to walk right in and grab a seat. The staff is very welcoming; upon walking in I was greeted by all of them and seated right away at the bar. 

Deciding on what to order here? Well, let me tell you that their signature dish: Jinya tonkotsu black (with pork chashu and pork broth) is delicious and tasty for the price of $13.80. I especially enjoyed the spicy, creamy vegan ramen with thick noodles for $12.50. I slurped the hell out of the food! And, had no shame doing it! You must understand that when eating ramen, it's all about that delicious tasty BROTH! Noodles are always going to be noodles, but the broth, OMG! It must be on-point! 

This place sure didn't disappoint during my visit. I really enjoyed it, especially during late-nights. I love that they serve cocktails and sake here as well. Make sure you taste one of those delicious dranks!",Positive,Moderate,Reasonable

Located on - 'bad & bougie' or rather the Rodeo Drive of Vancouver - Alberni Street (ladies bring the credit card - Jimmy Choo located right across the street), one knows that arriving here will be one posh experience! 

What a swanky classy high end joint indeed!!!

Very posh & finesse galore. I was mighty impressed! 

The lighting, chairs, colours, 3 levels, the rooftop deck, the bar = bravo B+B bravo!!! 

It's mind blowing atrium, glossy marble & dark wood features entice & excite!

There's even semi private tables (ask for them or put down a special request) tucked neatly away in corners - for those out on a serious date night! 

Prime cuts of steak are found right here!

Came in to test out the Happy Hour menu & I will say - I look forward to going back for dinner soon! 

My Mai Tai was packed with a good portion of rum that gave a nice punch after each sip - unlike some sad watered down happy hour drinks at other establishments! 

B+B has won many awards - deservedly! It is part of the GLOWBAL Group of restaurants. 

Listen folks or rather read the following important tip very carefully - order the calamari with the ginger chilli sauce (a must!), the delightfully tasting mussels & the tantalizing prawns & eggplant!!! 

Start with these 3 items & you will not be disappointed!!!

I don't get it. I first tried Cartems' donuts when they got started making them at the at Woodland Smokehouse commissary  (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/woodland-smokehouse-and-commissary-vancouver?hrid=-NbFdACq_djP_Iow_qon0w&page_src=shared_via_messages_or_emails) before the fire there.  I didn't enjoy them then, and never bothered tracking them down when they opened near Gastown. 

But they have continued to be popular and spread, so I had to try this new Main street location.  

Service staff was really disorganized behind the counter - all sorts of confusion over a set of offerings that are fairly straightforward. It shouldn't be that hard to sell donuts and coffee to people.  

I ordered the raspberry compote special donut of the day and an espresso.  The donut ($3.00) looked good on the rack, but was a major disappointment.  It was stale.  As if it had been made a day before. Oh, and the raspberry wasn't raspberry.  Unless raspberries have become strawberries in the alternative Cartems' universe.  I mentioned it to the staff and they said, ""Oh, they must have sent over strawberry instead.""  WTF?  ""They?"" ""Sent over?""  No response to the staleness issue? WTF?!?!?!?  No offer to make things better?  Fail.  Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/cartems-donuterie-vancouver-6?select=5eDZZ9KRS5OdjhdsJrbKCQ

The espresso was no better.  They had absolutely no shot pulling skill at all.  I'm guessing they are grinding too fine and stopping the shot too late.

134,"This is such a cute stop for a snack or breakfast I wish we had more time in Vancouver to try their delicious looking array of cakes!  Breka, was our stop to perk ourselves up after getting massages and that strawberry shortcake that the hubby and I split was definitely one of the best that I've had in a while. I hate cakes and pastries that are heavy and this one was light, fluffy and oh so good I could have another right now. I think the only downside to these pastries are that they are so light, you'd be temped to have more. The shortcake reminded me of one of those Chinese cakes that are fluffy and airy .  I also grabbed an apple tart bar for a snack later that day which was also tasty and it held up pretty nicely in our hotel mini fridge.

The girls working the counter moved that line quickly, it got packed suddenly so there wasn't that bad of a wait to order and get our grub. Pricing here isn't outrageous like some other places can be.  All of their delicious cakes were prices around $5 which is a pretty good deal and the seating area makes you want to lounge around for a while and eat more. Just like a lot of places and restaurants in this area, I have no idea of where you would park, it seems like street parking is you're best option, but if you don't have patience for that walk. It looks like everyone visiting and that lives in this neighborhood does that.

If you are in the Robson street area on the West side of Vancouver this is a nice stop over for a break and snack.

I passed by an noticed this brand new Uyghur restaurant just opened and couldn't resist popping in. It is a family run place with 3 generations - the eldest cooking in the back, the daughter running front of house and her young kids eagerly greeting new customers in front. They all had a very friendly welcoming vibe, and really tried to make you feel welcome at the restaurant. They did a nice job putting up some Uyghur decorating touches too all around the mid-sized restaurant, and were playing regional music as well. Nice!

There is a good variety of Uyghur dishes available, including a display case that has girde nan, stamped Uyghur nan, and various other Uyghur baked goods. But I couldn't resist trying out the laghman when I heard they were made in house. I ordered the anam ning laghman ($9.99 at lunch).

The laghman were very nicely prepared. They had a lovely bounce to them, were cooked perfectly, and soaked up the nicely spiced lamb and vegetable topping. There was a little bit of heat to the dish, but not overpowering.

Yawei from Innocent Coffee has reappeared in this hidden location and is still making her coffee a serving at a time.  The new location is in an alley, has a few seats and stools, and looks like a comfortable bright little spot reminiscent of the old location on a smaller scale.  

The pour over ($3.75) was always the strength at the old location, and it tasted just as good as at the previous location. I believe they are using Origins Organic beans.  

I understand they have a new partner on the barista front, so I'll likely give the espresso a try on a future visit and see how that compares.  

I wish them luck in this new location!

139,"This place was not the best and I can agree with most of the other reviewers. It was bland, overpriced, and service needs a lot of work. Went with a group of 6 people and all had similar thoughts; I got to try a few of their dishes and could agree. All their garnishes were small touch of baby spinach, for such a nice looking restaurant their dishes were not the prettiest.

The minced beef noodles was super disappointing, they had a tiny portion of minced beef (less than 50grams) for 13.75... apart from being spicy there was a lack of any meaningful flavour.

The beef brisket noodle soup was ok, but really nothing special for $14...if you do plan on getting that I'd recommend getting the spicy version as the non spicy tasted like any old soup and pretty bland. The spicy was a little more enjoyable but again nothing to rave about.

Also tried the pork belly appetizer which was really mediocre. The meat was similar to deli meat with some hot sauce and raw spinach. The mushroom appe was even worse in my opinion and we only ate a couple bites each because it was so tough to eat.

Atmosphere/service: The only good service was I think from what looked to be the owner (woman). I'll cut the other some slack because he was obviously learning. Appetizers came after all the main dishes. All the main dishes for each person except for mine came 10 minutes before my main noodle dish. The kitchen timing really needs work. No water refills and no one took finished plates or dishes. The music was way too loud we had to shout to the people on the other side of the table, I think until a more senior staff came in, he turned it down. The music got louder and louder as we sat (was classical almost Christmas music going...). My favourite part was watching one SERVER constantly rub his nose with his hand and NOT wash it. That turned me off the most. Being a new server or not you should know to wash your hands.

The rating was for lunch and we were the only table at the time in the restaurant...

Just some additional feedback, I would recommend that you get staff to dress in a slightly more work friendly attire. I don't expect professional work attire but when you spent so much on making the establishment look so physically appealing it hurts the image when you see the staff wearing ""Got Wood"" and big logo ""Christian Dior"" t-shirts.",Neutral,Good,Reasonable

141,"Found this place today while waiting for phone service and it was a perfect stop when tired of shopping! They granted me a special request crepe which included ham, feta and mozza cheeses, spinach, and strawberries (yes, strawberries). It seems that everywhere I go I seem to create new items, and no, I am not pregnant! Perhaps it's the creative influence of Wylie Dufresne, but I can't say for certain. :) 

Cheaper than the Crepe chain (and many of those are now defunct). Crepe was delicious and used fresh strawberries and spinach (unlike the other places) and while it might have been smaller it was packed with goodness and definitely enough food for lunch. The ham was diced in chunks, unlike the chemical laden ""slices"" found elsewhere.  Next time, I might opt out of feta + ham as it was just too salty for my liking, which has not always been the case with my fave crepe combo. 

While I was not interested in any of the sauces as they were of the savoury variety, I added natural greek yoghurt on top upon returning home, instead. 

Customer service was extra friendly, and the whole crepe was around $7. Where else can you get a satisfying lunch at that price? I was really impressed! 

This might just be my to go place the next time I am in need of a meal at Oakridge, and it definitely beat the White Spot or the rest of the food court in that regard.",Negative,Good,Cheap
142,"My friends were visiting from Vancouver and it made me realize that I hadn't written a review about Phnom Phenh, which was the culinary highlight of my family vacation! Omg howwwww have I not written a review until now?! We had so many disappointing food experiences during that week, I had all but given up until my friend Issabelle brought us here.

Phnom Penh is definitely a spot that you have to wait in line for, so be prepared to do so. I'm not usually one to wait more than five minutes for anything, mostly because I'm a spoiled princess, but Phnom Penh is worth it!!!!!! It was so busy the night that we visited the restaurant that we opted to sit with two other parties on the same table just so we could get in. Like most Asian restaurants, it's kind of disorganized, borderline unsanitary and service is never that friendly. But the garlic wings, butter beef and beef luc lac make all that insanity completely worth it! Until we ate dinner, all I could think was ""What the hell is going on here... why am I wasting my life here... what is that smell..."" But after that beef luc lac hit my tongue ""WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!!!"" And now all I can think is ""Why in God's name does Vancouver have to be so far away from Honolulu where I live?!""

My husband just saw a photo of butter beef as I was writing my review and he basically had an orgasm standing there remembering that dish. It's THAT GOOD. Don't worry about all the other craziness you have to deal with to get it, the food is worth the journey!",Neutral,Bad,Undefined
143,"UPDATE: I did receive a conciliatory sounding e-mail from the company that manages The Morrissey shortly after posting this review.

It Coulda Been Worse.

I made reservations for my birthday here. Everyone should have reservations about booking their birthday here. But hey -it coulda been worse. I could have made reservations for my funeral here.

My friends waited over 45 minutes for their appetizers to arrive. But it coulda been worse. They could have waited over an hour. Thank-you kitchen for not taking over an hour to prepare my friends appetizers.

My other friend waited so long to receive his food he had to get it to go. But it could have been worse. Instead of the waitress acting bitchy about it she could have slapped my friend across the face. Thank-you waitress for not slapping my friend across the face. 

We had to ask three times for water. But it coulda been worse. Instead of us having to navigate through a busy room with glasses of water we had fetched from the bar ourselves the waitress could have thrown the water in our faces. Thank-you for not throwing water in our faces. 

My other friends never received their entrees. At all. But it coulda been worse. Instead of them having to cancel their order and go home hungry they could have been poisoned. Thank-you for not poisoning my friends. 

The orders that did eventually make their way to the table were cold. But it coulda been worse. Instead of cold fries and warm beer we could have been served raw chicken. Thank-you for not giving us all salmonella. 

Every round of beer took over half hour to arrive. But it coulda been worse. Instead of running to the liquor store ourselves we sat there most of the night with empty glasses. Thank-you for not making us run to the liquor store. 

Then my friends who arrived a little late were made to wait in line even though we had two empty seats at our table waiting for them. When I explained that to the bouncer he dismissed me with a wave of his giant stupidhand and told me to go back inside. But it coulda been worse. Instead of just being a dick the bouncer could have kicked me in the nuts. Thank-you meathead for not kicking me in the nuts. 

When the bill finally arrived it was chockablock with errors. We were charged for the entree that never arrived as well as all kinds of food we never even ordered. Then it took over half an hour to fix it and bring a new bill. Which was still filled with errors. But it coulda been worse. Instead of simply acting belligerent, accusing us of trying to rip her off and then storming off in a snit our beloved waitress could have screamed expletives at us. Thank-you beloved waitress for not screaming expletives at us. 

And of course there was the 18% auto-gratuity. Which we were forced to pay for shitty service. But it coulda been worse. Instead of the auto-grat being 18% for shitty service it could have been a 100%. Thank-you for not charging a mandatory 100% auto-gratuity. 

When I phoned the next day to complain to the manager the chicken-shit never returned my call. But it could have been worse. Instead of having the balls to call and explain or apologize I could have wasted time talking to someone who obviously doesn't give a crap. Thank-you for ignoring me and turning me and all my friends against you instead of addressing whatever issues you were having that night. 

Naming your bar after the former lead singer of The Smiths doesn't make you cool either. But it coulda been worse. You could have been named after the lead singer from Nickelback. 

So for not taking over an hour to deliver some appetizers, for not slapping my friend, for not throwing water in our faces, for not poisoning us, for not giving us salmonella, for not making us go to the liquor store to pick up our own beer, for not kicking me in the nuts, for not screaming expletives at us, for not demanding a 100% auto-gratuity, for not returning my call and for not naming your shitty bar ""Chad"";

The other half of my medium pizza ($16) was a NYC pizza with Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, and Mushrooms. The traditional tastes of meat and mushrooms piled high on the pizza were satisfying; however, the crust needs to be much thinner to be a true New Yorker.

The decor is simple with a couple TVs playing sports. The beer selection was also simple, but a Ninkasi IPA was all I needed as a pizza partner. N.Y.C. Pizzeria is the type of place you come to eat when you're hungry and don't mind eating pizza on paper plates.",Neutral,Good,Undefined
145,"My fianc?? and I are steak connoisseurs. From restaurants in Vancouver to Montreal, we LOVE a good, juicy steak! We planned a double date here a few nights ago, and we were not disappointed at all - more so, very exceptionally impressed. 

The staff accompanied the four of us in a comfortable booth that was perfect for being able to view everything in the restaurant. The interior of this place I mean.. wow. The ambiance of it all was really cool, modern, relaxing, and sexy because of the dim lighting. It's super spacious - has two floors. And the restrooms were clean and well stocked of necessities. Well done. 

We ordered two ""Meat and Seafood Platter for Two"" for our group. $120.95 x 2 which was fine.. because it was TOTALLY worth it. From the steak, to the lobster, the prawns, mashed potatoes, asparagus, Brussel sprouts and all.. holy smokes! SO DAMN GOOD! Everything was cooked just right - we like ours medium rare and wasn't it just that to perfection. The flavour was so prominent - the seasonings, the sauces. Everything just melted heavenly in your mouth! Along with tequila shots, our night was delightful. 

Now.. for our service. 

Top. Notch. 

We had two: Marcelle and DK. They were both incredibly amazing! Marcelle brought out a board with the variety of steaks they offer and explained each of their qualities. He helped us choose our platter, and was extremely attentive all night. He joked with us, he was charismatic and funny. What a joy! We never had any of our glasses being empty because of DK. He always looked out for us, and made sure we were never without what we needed; liquor or water, or anything. I'm really picky on service when it comes to high quality restaurants and these two were simply exceptional. Best service I've received since Grinder in Montreal which was months ago. Please give these two recognition because seriously they are gems.

Came here for dinner one night with some friends, let's just say I did not pick this restaurant. The place was packed. Floor to ceiling windows are nice, and I guess you are paying for the ambience and the view of the harbor. 

We ordered several seafood dishes to share. The fish was fresh but the portion size was super small and tasted bland. And it was rather Expensive for what we got.

Service was spotty at times. They did have live music which was nice but the restaurant was so loud we couldn't hear the music or each other at all. 

I would not come back!",Neutral,Moderate,Expensive

The waiters are rude and pretentious. They do not write down your orders, resulting in them forgetting my food, while the rest of my table ate and finished theirs. I even asked 3 times (over a span of 40 minutes) to double check my order, however they continued to seat people instead, and I'm 100% certain they gave my order to someone else. People being seated AFTER us were getting their food first.  Do yourself a favour and eat elsewhere.

148,"* Bland in a crowded market *

This new donair spot also serves poutine and tacos - covering many of the favourite late night eats in the area that are served with places specializing in one of those three. I'm always cautious when a place tries to do too much, and unfortunately that caution was warranted.

I ordered the chicken donair ($8.50). 

The veggies were very fresh. But that is where the good news ended for me. 

The pita used was a commercial supermarket type pita, and it was crumbly. In other words, not particularly fresh, and already falling apart before it even had anything put into it. The pita was filled with those fresh veggies and one of the blandest chicken donair I've ever experienced. It had been sliced and was sitting in a steamer, so it tasted very much like steamed chicken rather than those rich flavours one would expect with donair. They added all the sauces before wrapping it and grilling it, so that bland filling got further marinated in the sauces and then warmed up. So you got a warm runny tzatziki mixed with warm slightly running hummus. It basically created a bland mushy mess in a pita that was falling apart. Oddly the hot sauces that were added didn't help with the blandness at all. Not sure why.

That was wrapped and served in a napkin instead of a basket - even though there were plenty of tables and this is not a primarily take-out spot. Odd serving choice (and the reason for no picture as I couldn't put it down without it all falling apart). 

Overall there are much better options for donair within a 2 minute walk. I didn't try the tacos or poutine, but I imagine the taco focused and poutine focused places within a 3 minute walk would also be better.

This one is a definite skip for me.",Positive,Good,Reasonable

Seriously folks, self-taught Monica Tang's (the owner) cakes without cows milk and eggs blow the others out of water. Still not convinced? Just look up ""Dairy is Scary"" on YouTube because in this day and age, no one needs dairy in their food when there are readily available  and delicious substitutes.  

I've had almost every kind of vegan cake, but when I came across a vegan tiramisu by chance I was so stoked because I assumed it was one of those things I had to give up.  All I can say is wow, the texture is so airy and smooth and has that not too sweet taste.  Perfect balance of cream and sponge cake too!  Someone described it as ""cake with tiramisu flavor"" and it sounds just about right. Her cakes are so pretty to look at too.  Just go on her website and you can see her instagram-worthy creations.  

As of now, you can find the tiramisu at Vegan Supply, Body Energy Club, Westwood Organics, and Spents Grounds...or you can order online at her website.

When we walked in there was an unusual, bad smell, so bad that they had to leave the door open making it very cold inside, they wouldn't say what it was. The decor was odd, a bunch of orchids in pots, some still with the clear plastic and tags even though some were already dying. There's a TV on the wall showing a looping video of energetic chefs in white uniforms cooking some amazing looking food in a very organized kitchen. Not sure what the purpose of the video is, as the kitchen and the cooks in this place look nothing like those in the video, they weren't wearing chef whites. We ordered 3 different soups and found that they were all bland and oily, as was the cucumber dish which looked like they were smashed rather than sliced with a knife.

It was a 15 minutes walk from our hotel in downtown.  I was surprised to see a line of about 20 in front of the restaurant at 1000am.  All the locals and tourists were out having breakfast here.  

There is no wait list.  You must stand in line and wait to be seated.  It took about 40 minutes until we got a table.  I didn't mind the wait because I love the breakfast/brunch thing.  The cafe is small hence the long wait.  

The menu is extensive with so many breakfast and lunch options.  I already knew what I wanted to order after browsing through the Yelp photos.  It was so difficult to decide since everything looks so delicious!

*****Smoked salmon Benedict:: poached eggs with Steelhead smoked salmon, cream cheese over a toasted English muffin.  Add the sliced avocado.  So good!!!  I like that they allow you to order half. 

****Harrison salmon scramble:: scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, onions, cream cheese on multi grain toast.  Served with a bean salad in house vinaigrette.  Healthy and good!

155,"Fine Dining in a Park - Part One

I'm doing something different this trip to Vancouver. Instead of searching for the best dim sum and Chinese cuisine, I am exploring a couple of fine dining restaurants inside World famous parks.

Located in the heart of Queen Elizabeth Park in the midst of gorgeous floral displays as well as a panoramic view of downtown Vancouver, Seasons in the Park is a hot spot for tourists and locals alike.

Knowing well in advance that I am paying mostly for the view and the location, I kept my expectations on the food reasonably low, but was pleasantly surprised.

GRILLED VEAL PAILLARD:  The veal was cooked on a wood fired grill and it carried a sizzling aroma that filled the air of the table. It was very well seasoned with herbs and peppers, and was served with a super yummy sauce.  Side dishes include some fresh veggies and a generous serving of mushroom risotto.  The risotto had a perfect texture and was rich in wild mushroom flavors.  The dish was almost perfect, except that the veal paillard itself was a bit on the chewy side, which defies the definition of a paillard.  I speculate that it might have been overcooked as it came out completely well done.

SPAGHETTI BOLOGNESE:  This is one of my favorite comfort foods and I am very picky about how it's prepared. Seasons didn't disappoint and my favorite dish was well executed.  The pasta was perfectly al dente and was served piping hot - exactly how it's supposed to be served. The sauce was very rich and tasted like a medley of ground beef, tomato puree, and fresh herbs and spices.  Not a hint of canned tomato sauce or any artificial flavors!

The place was absolutely lovely.  Service was friendly and attentive. Overall, it was a delightful dining experience. I would definitely return when I visit Vancouver again.",Positive,Good,Expensive
156,"In my explorations of all the micro coffee roasters in Vancouver, I came across Agro further east than I intended to go but glad I did make the trek here.  It's a beautiful space with equally nice drinks made with care.

Agro is in an commercial and industrial zone and trekking out here was a bit nutty with the traffic and lack of parking.  Though it's a warning, dont let that detour you from trying out Agro.  This spots is such a nice place ...  open, vibrantly lit, and perfect to take a cup out or sit to chat with others.  The space has many options from little tables for one to large communal tables to share and discuss ideas like best place to eat Chinese food or the fine line between a derpy dog and a cute one.  

I have to admit that I was loving the space for it's beautiful back drop of taking pictures.  It's just made for it on the communal table... there's a lot incredible soft light that comes in from the North facing window.  So thanks to Agro for putting up with me and taking a few shots before actually taking a first sip and enjoying it.

Cappuccino - Made with care, I anticipated drinking this as I first inhaled the aroma.  This one has more bite than the usual beans with an sharp edge of marmalade and acidity in it.  It did start and finish strong but I liked the flavour as it was balanced well with the milk.  It might not be a good starter drink for a beginner but I think most people can appreciate this one.  4/5

I know this is out of the way but with most roasters, they're not in the middle of a burbs or city block.  Of you happen to pass along the way, it would be a decent stop for a cup of coffee if you need that caffeine kick.",Positive,Good,Undefined
157,"Bao Bei is a good place... no great place for friends and families to share bites, share a few stories for laughs, and enjoy good drinks.  This atmosphere was one of the best ones I experienced in my visit in Vancouver AND it was on a weekday.  Is it authentic Chinese?  No but they never claim to be... with the title of Chinese Brasserie, it's a modern take with a nod to the past.  I keeps to some of the wonderful classics while still adding a bit of a nuanced change to keep things interesting.

With warnings of no reservations, I made my way early on a weekday for dinner.  I was told it will be packed... they did not lie.  At first opening, you have the many tables and bar seatings available but it quickly fills up with young professionals, laughter, and many manicured hands holding drinks.  What I love is that this is not a stuffy meat market ... this is definitely a place to feel comfortable in and enjoy some really great bites.  The place is modern and open with heavy influences of chinoiserie without being stereotypical in a bad way.  Just key motifs to compliment. 

Service here was great ... our server was just hopping in a good way.  He was so energetic and knew the menu back and front.  With so many interesting flavours and takes on classic Chinese dishes, it does help to ask questions on what is their most popular.  We went with a series of his best hit and he never wrong.  The service was really crisp and quick... I dont think we every had a moment where it lapsed once.

Bean curd skins - With tender bean curd skins, chewy king mushrooms, and a kicking chilli Ginger vinaigrette, this was a nice wake up call to the taste buds. It looks boring but the flavour is wonderfully potent and bold with a fiery ginger and spicy kick.  The bean curd absorbed all the sauce... I kinda wished they gave me rice at this point to pour the remaining sauce.  5/5

Beef tartare - Claimed as one of Vancouver's best tartare, I had to try and This was definitely a nice take on the classic French dish.  Rich, meaty, smooth... all the good stuff you want in a tartare.  The Asian spin was the addition of quail eggs, crispy taro chips, a savoury scallion oil, a pungent (in a good way) preserved mustard root, crispy and crunchy shallots, and a good kick of ginger to tie it together.  It was very good.  Is it Vancouver's best?  Im not sure but its definitely up there... have to try more!  4.5/5

Steam prawn dumplings - These were cute.  The skins were nice and thin and the plump prawns inside were cooked fairly well.  I just felt they understeamed the skin... it was just a bit too al dente that the thicker edges felt like it needed a bit more steam.  Chives give it a lift of flavour to the very subtle flavours of the prawn and scallops inside.  Otherwise, I was happy with the fat prawns any day.  3.5/5

Crispy pork belly - This dish is not your typical pork belly.  It comes with the ingredients separate and then you're told to mash and mix them all together.  So you get chunks of crispy potatoes, bright acidity from the pickled veg, and then the fatty juicy pork belly that you shred up to mix it all together.  Personally I would have liked to have more pickled veg to cut through the fat and more crispy potatoes but that's just me.  4/5

Lamb Shao Bing - This was not what I was expecting but it was an interesting take.  A fresh hot 'bun' ... more like a flat bread holds together slices of tender lamb and tons of cilantro.  I know the menu said cumin lamb which is more a Northern Chinese style of cooking.  I honestly didnt taste any cumin ... if it was there, it was drowned out by the cilantro.  Overall I found this one to be fun but not a must try from their menu.  3.5/5

You tiao ... aka stuffed doughnuts - I was expecting the super long sticks of fried dough but what appeared on the table was quite the opposite.  Doughnuts!  Passionfruit rhubarb filled ones!!  I LOVED the filling... gooey thick custardy tart and sweet passionfruit just oozing out of freshly fried hot dough.  What's not to like? I love how this wasn't overly sweet... fair warning, these are hefty desserts.  4.5/5

Overall, I loved this meal... service is fun and attentive.  Atmosphere is vibrant and interesting.  Food has some real highlights.  It's not a romantic date spot but definitely one that you can bring friends to for a good night out.  Just get here early cause the line up kept coming and coming and coming... for good reason, the food will definitely be keeping you coming back.",Positive,Good,Undefined

The atmosphere is casual and the interior decor has just the right amount of cultural artworks. A wall in the waiting area showcases the many accolades this place have collected over the years. 

Being one of the most reviewed restaurants in Vancouver, it doesn't come as a surprise to see a line out the door at all hours of the day. 

After perusing the encyclopedia of a menu, we opted for shared-plates style dining. 

BUTTER BEEF
Their signature dish was beautifully plated with tender seared beef slices swimming in a tangy, umami and garlicky sauce topped with cilantros. It's akin to a beef carpaccio. I'm not one for raw food so I found the most cooked piece and took a bite. It was one delicious bite! A must try! 

FRIED CHICKEN WINGS
The wings were well seasoned, deep fried and studded with garlic, black peppers and spring onions accompanied by a dipping sauce of lime juice, salt and pepper were absolutely addicting! 

AMOK
A national dish of Cambodia was a huge disappointment here. It was more of a Vietnamese rendition of what could have been an aromatic flavorful dish. Steamed curried fish with greens and a drizzle of coconut cream was lacking the balance of sweet and savory. 

PHNOM PENH NOODLES
While the dish had all the right ingredients and it does work well together, I found it to be a little on the bland side. But, nothing a dash of soy sauce, hoisin sauce and a squeeze of lime couldn't fix. 

BEEF LUC LAC
Beef fillets coated in thick savory sauce served over white rice topped with a fried egg accompanied by a nuoc mam dipping sauce was hearty and full of flavors.

Owners like to personally make sure that customers are satisfied and they are always lending a hand wherever needed. They also frequently update their wares and facility to keep it clean and up-to-date.

All the dishes are top quality and they don't Cheap out on ingredients. Ever since the introduction of All You Can Eat BBQ, that's become my go-to.

Unlike most all you can eat where meat is of low quality and services lack, this place does not disappoint. Not only that, they offer many different types of flavor of meat which is rare(I suggest garlic, I can consume that all night long). I've seen some reviews here that states that the place was smokey. It's BARBECUE! What do you expect? Ventilation is on along with additional ceiling fans, smoke was not at all problematic.

Now couple all of this with some green bottles and you're good to go.

Try it for yourself. I highly recommend it.",Positive,Good,Undefined

Most of their customers are all Koreans so it is quite authentic. Get some of their bbq meats. Beef, pork, chicken bbq are all great! Stronger flavours. The authentic dishes would be the pork steaks and pork belly- which have less flavour.",Positive,Good,Undefined
163,"I was walking by and thought the lunch board outside had a picture of ramen. It looked really really good. The ramen slut never passes up a chance to explore a new ramen place. When I got inside I pointed to the picture and was told it was not ramen but a bulgogi stew that is meant to be eaten with rice. Well I was already there so might as well. First out came three small dishes that I stared at wondering if they were mine. Cold kimchi, cold sprouts and cold chunks that tasted kind of sweet and I determined they were potato. I had no idea what to do so I started snacking on ten thinking they were an appetizer. When the meal came it was very hot boiling soup with an assortment  of mushrooms, onions, veg and bulgogi. The broth was super flavorful. It was really really freaking good and I was amazed at home much food I got for $10.  The service was prompt and polite as well. 

Ramen is my number one lunch go to so I don't think I will replace that anytime soon however I won't hesitate on coming back here again, fantastic food and prices. (I glanced at the rest of the menu)

They have karaoke rooms in the back so I bet it's bumping at night, during the day it was a nice comfortable place to eat.

164,"* Duffin's Express North? *

There used to be only one spot in town that had an eclectic menu of items such as Mexican Tortas and Vietnamese Subs.  And that was Duffin's on Main.  

And then Duffin's opened up on Knight - Duffin's East.  

But then Duffin's on Main closed and the corner got redeveloped.  

So we were back to one.  

But now TK Sub Cafe has opened.  It isn't a Duffin's.  But the menu sure looks pretty similar - although much trimmed down.  Perhaps ""Duffin's Express North?""  (It is also on Knight - but up North by Kingsway.)  

But alas, I believe this is a different business.  Perhaps this one woman shop has some previous connection to Duffin's though?!?!??  

She has improved on the lemongrass chicken recipe for sure.  After ordering the $3.75 Lemongrass chicken Vietnamese sub, she asked me if I wanted it spicy and I replied yes.  She went off to the kitchen and prepared it fresh. The chicken looked quite thin, but was still moist, and while it wasn't spicy at all - the chicken had a TON of lemongrass. I'm guessing that is what she meant by spicy? I loved the lemongrass flavour!  It was nicely contrasted by the pickled veggies and brightened by the fresh cucumber. 

The bread was very similar to Duffin's.  Same supplier perhaps?!?!?!??

Overall, I'm looking forward to seeing how she develops this spot and what other menu items may appear?  (Duffin's fried chicken anyone?!?!?!?)

I'm looking forward to returning and trying the machaca torta to see how it compares to the one at Duffin's! (Yes, that is already on the menu and calling me back!)",Undefined,Moderate,Reasonable

After decades of committing unrestrained burgercide across the country, I finally met burger revenge in the form of a killer burger. It innocently goes by the name Black Molly, but brings you immediately closer to your impending death with Philly Steak, Provolone Cheese, and Bacon. 

It's a beefy Burgernator sent from the present to kill your future. When this burger says, ""I'll be back,"" it means literally ... with clogged arteries and a flabby new tire for your gut. 

The good news? Well, the Black Molly is pretty tasty, so you may gladly accept your death sentence with a smile on your face and joy on your taste buds. 

Want to know the even better news? Killer Burger's Epic Burger is even tastier and more lethal than the Black Molly. Consider it the T-1000 (tasty-1000) advanced prototype of the burger battle thanks to Bacon, Pulled Pork, BBQ Sauce, and Texas Slaw on a Beef Burger Beast capable of terminating even the healthiest of diets.

168,"I figured that once more photos appeared, this place might pique people's interest. I had received a ""free tartlet card"" which was also a great excuse for a visit. It's a cute little shop, albeit, a bit on the ""cold"" atmosphere side, and it's a nice alternative to macarons, cupcakes and the like. 

They offered teeny-tiny, flaky, little samples that didn't really give me an idea about the actual tarts; they were quite small and didn't provide any of the flavours I was seeking, but at least they gave me a bit of an idea about the pastry. I found the pastry straw samples a bit strange as they were more like crumbly pastry dregs, but maybe that's your thing? 

I tried the feta red pepper tart which was quite good and I highly recommend heating it up. This one I opted to take away, and I was glad that I did. I did notice a toaster oven there, so I'm guessing if you opt to stay that they'll do it for you. 

Also tried a mini raspberry which I ate on the spot. It offered a nice, flaky pastry but less filling than I'd hoped for and did not seem as fresh as I'd liked. Still, I ate it quite quickly and in two little bites and it was good. I am sure that this one would have tasted better heated, too. 

The chocolate ones looked divine but were too big for a ""tiny"" treat, so perhaps I'll return again to try another. And I purchased a tiny butter tart and was told that it was equally as good. (I do have some willpower.) 

I appreciate that they don't want to make too many and I would certainly return when craving a savoury or sweet, but it is not what I'd call a destination place. Still, it's in a great location, so I think they'll be ok. They'll have to change the wording on their lovely retro ""only one in Vancouver"" signage if another shop suddenly appears, however.   

$13 for one big tart ($9 with tax) and two minis ($2 each) which seemed a bit pricy, but expected.

The charming prince among the Makoto mix wasn't the cold Seafood, old Sushi Rolls, thin Sashimi, suspect Mongolian BBQ ingredients, Chinese Stir-fry, salty Soups, or fried Frozen Fish. It should have been the exit. That was my second favorite. How can an individually-wrapped Bunny Ice Cream Fluorescent Orange Creamscicle Pop be the best thing at a buffet? Answer: when the fodder is Makoto Japanese Buffet.

Of course, no one should expect a Vegas-style or Vegas-quality buffet here, but most supermarkets and high schools have better Asian food than this. Why did I go back for a second visit? First, to not judge too negatively the buffet and to give Makoto a second chance. More importantly, because my wife finds the thin, soft, and soggy crab legs to be Cheap ($16.99) and crabby.

But when AC forces you to check your carry on luggage on an empty plane (not kidding) and you arrive an hour late after midnight on a weekday, pickings are slim when looking for a meal, so reluctantly, we tried it out.

The place was buzzing and service was good. We each ordered a drink (wine and beer; both fine) and I settled on the infamous perogies. Of course, they were deep fried as all frozen, tasteless perogies are done nowadays (sigh) which is not how to serve a perogy. But they were fine. The polish sausage add on was decadent but pretty tasty, actually. The sour cream and onions helped, too. 

We were recommended to try the flatbread pizza, and unbeknownst to us, it also came with the same sausage. It was fine, but I would have preferred to have ordered at least one dish without sausage. It was served with a nice sized salad which made up for the miniscule sized pizza. I'm sure I could have made a doctored up frozen pizza at home just the same, but hey, it was all fine. 

So, if you've been wondering about this place for as long as I had debated trying it out, you can go and it will be exactly as you expected but with better service.

The brunch menu was a well balanced combination of sweet and savory dishes. I ordered the eggs benedict with bacon instead of ham and the hollandaise and side potatoes were all delicious. The french toast was also tasty and there were several other dishes that I wished I could have tried. Several brunch cocktails looked unique and interesring too beyond your typical Mary. 

Elements service excelled and it was a warm and friendly experience. My coffee cup remained full and hot and it's nice to dine at a place that isn't operating your run of the mill order first at the counter and the customer does all the work place.

The taco truck was perhaps one of the very first food trucks way back when. Those 3 tacos for $2.99 days are long gone.

Enter Marimba. $10.50 for 3 empanadas with creative descriptions.

I got a mix of the Marimba empanada (hibiscus flower, cream cheese, and caramelized onions with a sweet chipotle sauce) and the Mex Veggie empanada (diced veggies with ""feta"" cheese and a BBQ tamarind sauce).  

They came nicely presented in a box, topped with a cabbage slaw and some pica de gallo. On the side they had options for 3 additional sauces - a mild tomatillo, a medium chipotle, and a hot habanero. 

The empanadas were freshly fried after ordering, so they came nicely hot and crisp. The wrapper was a lighter texture with good external crunch. 

The Mex Veggie filling was a bit overprocessed and tasted more like a veggie paste than any noticeable distinctive veggies. It shared similarities with a fast food egg roll filling. My guess is that the ""feta"" was actually queso fresco as it had a taste more typical of queso fresco than feta. But perhaps it was a very mild feta. Overall I likely would not order this one again, as it was rather dull in its overall flavour profile.

The Marimba was visually stunning with a bright purple inside. The hibiscus blended with the cream cheese and caramelized onions to provide almost a dessert like flavour profile. It was by far the better choice - but a serving of 3 would become a bit too much.

So overall, a nice addition with some creativity in the menu. I hope they fine-tune their fillings a little bit to build up a lasting clientele. I wish them well!",Undefined,Moderate,Reasonable
195,"Always remember to look up when you're out & about! 

I was reminded of this when I actually looked up high as I was passing Hy's Steakhouse + Cocktail Bar! 

Heard about it, never been & always wondered! 

My brain finally clued in one day a few weeks ago - ooh this is Hy's! 

I've passed by several times while walking around downtown & never paid attention! 

What an intriguing, eye catching unique building!!! 

On top of that it's a - stand alone! 

Historic indeed since 1955 (at this location since the 60s), why have I never eaten here!?? 

Like fine wine this restaurant is timeless. 

To be honest I wouldn't have appreciated Hy's in my 20s (which was just a shy couple years ago - LMAO). 

I was still maturing & figuring out life - to busy to actually sit down & enjoy a classic steak on a magic night out. 

The brick & iron siding had me thinking - dungeons & dragons! Perhaps GOT anyone!?! 

Today I brought out the E.B.T. (see my Elise Steakhouse review for acronym meaning) card! 

I knew tonight was going to be a classy, elegant & supreme night - I pulled out my GQ bespoke suit! 

Someone even asked for my autograph - oh that was me looking in the mirror! LMAO!!!

Located in central downtown Vancouver, plenty of parking available or use the valet service. 

The general clientele of Hy's appear older & look like they've been coming here for years. 

We started with drinks - the Dark + Stormy & Vesper - very delightful cocktails - cheers! 

For dinner we had scallops (so delicious), sablefish (amazing) & peppercorn New York steak - a juicy tender easy to chew steak! 

By the way, I can confirm that the Cheese Bread is to die for - it's truly irresistible!!! 

The cheesecake dessert - oh my one of the best I've ever had!!! 

The bottom level of Hy's is more historic to how it was in the 60s - the upper level was modernized about 5 years ago & has had some up to date significant touches. 

Happy Hour is held here upstairs Monday to Friday. 

Hy's is truly one of Vancouvers top historic restaurants.

196,"I was so excited to see this place change hands that I almost reviewed it before I had even tasted the food.  I might not have made ftr to review, but you might say that I was ftr to review the victuals. :) If country kitchen met cool and invited the nicest bouncer ever to reign in his beloved fans--an Heirloom you would find! 

Interesting picks:
v=veggie  and gf= gluten free.  r=raw
This is for those people like me, whose fave food are ribs, cheeseburgers, pasta and pizza. I was skeptical at first, of course, but I could not resist the charm of this place. I was not disappointed and it was definitely light.

Food:  4+ stars, but I'm no vegan expert, hence my 5 overall rating.

1. The Heirloom popcorn looked tasty although I was not here for that! Recommended for a snack. (v, gf) $3

2. Pappardelle-looked absolutely amazing like my fave pasta place.  I want to walk back there right now and order some. Complete with tomato ale pomodoro, lentils, spinach, roasted shallots and black pepper ricotta. $17.

3. Avocado frites-paprika batter and smoked catsup. The ""ketchup"" was more like a tomato jam that I ate alone after I gobbled up the entire thing. Great to share with two. I don't even love tomato jam. This was the ultimate hit here. It looked as great as it tasted. $12

4. Stew-white beans, delicate squash, parsnip cauliflower mash, popped barley- hearty dish for a winter night. Above average and tasty. $16.

5. Raw Cauliflower Risotto-pumpkin seed pesto walnut cheese, watermelon radish. I ordered this as my main. My companion thought there was cheese in it, so I was on my own here. As it turned out, there was no cheese, but I was fooled. It was good, but my least favourite. Hearty and huge. Definitely would have been better to share. Nicely presented. $13.

6. Dessert-we received the last Chai Pumpkin Mousse dish which was light, fluffy and delicious. Perhaps a bit tart but a nice touch. Next time I'd try to order one of the other two which were just as appealing: Vanilla chia pudding-$12. or Chocolate Semolina cake. $12.

The atmosphere, service and proprietor were all a five. The decor was great from the tea set to the water pump in the display case above the bar.  The music  was lounge like and welcoming. The bathrooms were ultra cool. The crowd included everyone from hipsters, hippies, an older crowd, younger crowd, and of course, the lovely, single ladies of Sogra. (Did they nail their target market,or what?)

I came for something light and I didn't want to spoil my night by memorizing the menu. They really should add the menu to their website, but I suppose it will all come in good time!  For drinks, there was a vast array of wine to be ordered in addition to cocktails. Mine, although not my usual Pinot Gris, was a delicious, comparable pinot blanc or something quite similar. No matter; it was good and satisfied my craving. They also serve an array of herbal teas and 49th parallel coffee. Sometime, if you're lucky, you might even get to see them turn on the white mod coffee machine. I would return again just to see that. I'm not even kidding! 

This is probably one of my longest reviews ever, but if it doesn't provide you with enough suggestions, then do walk in (no resos needed or taken) and see for yourself. You'll be welcomed immediately either at the bar/lounge area or otherwise, meatatarian or no.  Although I wouldn't say that this is the type of food that I usually crave for dinner, at least I can feel pretty healthy in spite of drinking, eating, and ordering dessert, which isn't a bad thing at all. If you have any doubt, step on the bathroom scale the next day--you won't be disappointed.",Positive,Undefined,Reasonable
197,"* The Definition of Torpedo *

Urban Dictionary has multiple definitions or ""Torpedo"":  

- To betray, backstab, diss, or punk someone with the intent of causing harm to their reputation.
- When objects or people look beautiful from far away, but dangerous or ugly up close.  
- A long turd.

The menu sounded promising (although overpriced for a food truck) with some nice classic sandwiches on offer. I ordered the ""mumia"" ($12) - which I have to assume is a play on Mumia Abu-Jamal who is from Philadelphia, home of the cheesesteak?  Anyhoo...

The description was very cheesesteak like with sirloin beef, pepperjack cheese, sauteed onions and peppers. The addition of garlic aioli moved away from the classic as did the usage of pepperjack instead of provolone. When I unwrapped the sandwich, I was torpedoed with an excessive amount of a watery oily substance dripping all over the place. It got all over everything - not in a good way. Biting into the sandwich was the next torpedoing. The bread was stale. I don't mean day old. I mean stale. 

Next torpedo:  the beef was chewy, gristly, and very oily. The peppers were the best part - but they too were overly oily. Basically each bite gave you a mouthful of stale bread, a piece of oily gristle flavoured by an oily pepper and a drippy oily substance (perhaps a broken aioli?). I couldn't eat the bread. Tried picking off the meat and veggies to eat, but gave up as they were too awful on their own.

They said that they were going to give the kitchen a chance to ""catch up"" and this on a busy Sunday lunch time. Yogi (the proprietor), was not around but I would be surprised if he would have permitted that to happen. Too bad as we had to leave without eating here (again). 

I love this restaurant, but service has always been an issue, and I have had to walk away too many times now when I only have 90 minutes (which seems pretty Reasonable to me). Sort it out, Heirloom.

199,"4+  star food and 5 star exceptional service and ambiance!  

It's hard to believe that this place had already existed for two years as a winery before it became a restaurant. Well, it was certainly a refreshing change from the other wine places around town, and it did not disappoint! 

We arrived to a cool-chic, casual vibe and a welcoming staff. We tried three flights of wine and they did not disappoint. It was a tough call, but perhaps the  white/rose was the best. BC does not have the best climate for reds, and I wanted the best. The tastings were so much fun! My one regret is that I forgot to buy a bottle of their Vancouver Urban Winery chardonnay. It was a pleasantly surprising winner (and you might not already know it but usually I'm partial to the pinot gris).
 
We wanted to order food that was ""not the norm"" as nowadays so many dishes are tirelessly repeated, and I did not want to order something that I knew I could find better elsewhere. 

So this is what we picked and it did not disappoint:

1. Ruby Red Beet Dip $9 (goat cheese, marcona almonds, fresh veggies)-a beautiful shade of fuchsia that came with an array of veg and a few delectable bread triangles. Quite rich and unique as I couldn't get over eating something so pink that wasn't sweet. Definitely fun to try in lieu of the more traditional dishes.

2. Mediterranean Tuna Two Ways $15 (watercress salad, roasted artichoke puree, baby heirloom tomatoes, cured cucumber)-surprisingly one of my fave dishes; A great complement to the beet.

3. Belgard Meatballs $12-fresh mozza, San Marzano tomato sauce; although on the heavier side, this dish was amazing. Not Chicago Avec amazing, but def. one of our favourite dishes. 

4. Flank Steak w/ Chimichurri $13 (Argentinian spice rub, malbec molasses)-while tender, served after the heavenly meatballs, it was just too cold. This one should have come first. The server was apologetic. It was still quite good.

5. Pear Bread Pudding $6-(red wine poached pears, a la mode) So glad we tried this and paired with a small taste of red wine to accompany it, this was such a nice touch. Def. a hit.

This was all we needed to order and we certainly left satisfied.  In sum, this place comes highly recommended by me whether on a date, with your friends, or even with your mom. And a note to single guys--we noticed that many girls dined here in groups, so I would go here too, if I were you.",Neutral,Good,Reasonable
200,"Warning:  ***** Do not read to the end if you like happy endings. *****

Today was a budget sushi lunch kind of day.  I longingly walked towards Yamato, my standby for budget sushi.  The only problem with Yamato is that the space is just way too small, and by the time I got there today it was way too full to grab a quite bite.  

Reluctantly I went a few doors down to Jako.  I will never make that mistake again!  There is a reason Yamato has big crowds and Jako had only 3 tables taken.  The nigiri had rice that fell apart upon being lifted.  The fish was sliced sloppily.  The tuna had also not been defrosted correctly and was mushy.  Ugh.  

The miso soup had almost nothing in it except for some scraps, and I mean SCRAPS, of tofu that was as if someone had cleaned off a cutting board where they had cut tofu and just dropped the crumbs into the soup.  Double ugh!

Then the kicker - as I was getting to my salmon nigiri (which looked fresh) I noticed something little and black.  I picked it up for further inspection.  Crawly critter.  I called over the waitress and she took away the box for inspection by her, another waiter and the sushi ""chef.""  (Term used loosely)

She came back and pronounced that it had been a black sesame seed.  Come on.  With legs?  Hello?  They gave me two new pieces of salmon nigiri.  As I was sitting there with a dumbfounded look on my face, a fly came over and landed on it.  Ok.  Enough.  Never again!",Negative,Good,Cheap
201,"* Authentic Burmese Hole in the Wall with a few other things thrown in *

This spot is easy to miss.  It is a counter tucked into a small convenience store on Joyce Street, not too far from the Joyce Skytrain station.  He has a single seat at the counter and 2 small tables with 2 seats each.  So a grand total of 5 spots to sit.  Classic!  

Bo used to be the chef at a restaurant downtown which closed 2 months ago, and he opened up this little counter in his friend's convenience store.  Originally from Burma, he apparently also used to work as a chef in several countries in Southeast Asia (including Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore) and picked up recipes along the way.

During the week the menu is quite simple - a selection of 4 different wraps, and laksa.  On Saturday and Sunday he does Burmese specials which vary each weekend.  

From the Burmese offerings I've tried the Laphet Thote (pickled tea leaf salad).  I don't know of any other spot in Vancouver that offers this, and the taste is QUITE addictive.  Bo imports the pickled leaves from Burma and puts together a very nice dish.  The texture contrasts between the pickled tea leaves, tomatoes, cabbage, dried/fried beans, toasted peanuts, and crunchy garlic chips is amazing.  There is a hint of fermented shrimp to round out the flavours along with a few raw garlic cloves and raw bird chili peppers.  Truly a wonderful dish with complex layers of flavour that all go well together.  It goes very well with the jasmine tea he serves.

His laksa is one of the only ones I've had in Vancouver that actually had fresh daun laksa (laksa leaf) in it.  There is a generous amount of shrimp, chicken, fish balls, tofu puffs, and a full boiled egg.  The noodles were the perfect consistency.  The broth was fabulous.  It has nicely layered flavours.  

Also tried the ""roti wrap"" which is not served in a roti.  It is served in a tortilla.  This is basically a chicken and vegetable curry wrap.  The curry sauce was the highlight of this dish.  I would prefer it with an actual roti instead of a tortilla.  Apparently sometimes he makes fresh roti, but not for the wraps.  During the week I'll stick to the laksa and whatever Burmese specials might sneak onto the menu.

Overall this place is a find.  It will take a while for him to figure out what to offer more regularly, and what items to drop.  But it is exciting to see him experiment each week!  

I'll definitely be back!",Undefined,Moderate,Undefined
202,"I usually hate Safeway... In the USA! But here in Canada, I love that they have their own dedicated parking garage, you have multiple points of entry/exit, the store is kept immensely clean and selections are packed a-plentiful especially given the store being in a city.

Came here earlier this morning because I really hate the features of the hotel that I'm staying at (Days Inn Vancouver Airport, and yes I have a 2-star review of it up already). Anyway, found myself in the bath aisle, excuse me, *washroom* aisle (this is Canada, get the fuck out of here with your ""restroom"", USA!). Got myself shampoo, body wash, and lotion. No tissues.

Toured produce, selection seemed fresh. However since I'm not living here, there was no need to buy any. Didn't have time to tour any of the other departments, but I did buy an umbrella which I found in a rack by the customer service counter past the check out stands.

Speaking of checkout, they take Android Pay here. In fact, on a sidenote, I've noticed a lot of places in Vancouver take Android/Apple Pay, but I know of few places in the United States that do.

Customer service was neat-o, cashier was kind, we chatted briefly about differences between USA-California and Canada-Vancouver, and the cashier was surprised that in California by law most places are required to charge 10 cents for a freaking plastic bag, when they just give em out like free candy here in Vancouver apparently.

As far as entry/exit points: When you enter the underground garage, you can either enter from the street above or the street below. Once you enter the garage and park your car, there are two doors you can go to on either side, or if you're on the street side above you can enter from yet another two front entrances. There's also an elevator and escalator, with a special escalator that'll take your shopping cart up to the actual store itself. Very few places in the US do this, except for maybe the big metropolitan cities like Chicago, NYC and LA/SFO, you just don't see these types of cart-escalators in most major grocery stores USA-side.

Sabor is a fairly small restaraunt but it doesnt feel overly tight or uncomfortable. It is decorated in your typical American Mexican fashion and overall casual. The servers were very pleasant and attentive and the food was delivered hot and quickly. 

Speaking of the food...Sabor serves most of what you would expect and was fresh and flavorful. I thought their tortilla chips were above average and were warm and well salted. The salsa was nice but they could easily upgrade and make their salsa really pop and turn it into a unique reason to dine here.

206,"* French poor value truck *

Is it just me or are food trucks starting to charge restaurant prices more and more?  

This truck specializes in some French dishes like bouch??e a la reine and beef Bourguignon, as well as sandwiches.  I wasn't in the mood for the heaviness of one of the classic French dishes (and don't particularly need to eat those from a box off a truck quite frankly) and opted for a ""simple sandwich"" as they refer to it.

The guy taking the order was kind of grumpy and not particularly welcoming. It didn't seem like he was very enthused to be working the truck.  

The veggie sandwich had pesto, lettuce, spinach, roasted peppers, roasted tomatoes,  mozzarella cheese on grilled ciabatta ($9.45). The pesto had a nice basil hit, and the roasted peppers rounded out the flavours. The roasted tomatoes were not noticeable at all - perhaps there was a single small slice. The bread was grilled and served warm and was extremely crunchy.  The mozzarella was grated and still unmelted in most spots - they hadn't really heated up the sandwich long enough to melt it at all.  While the sandwich was fine, it was nothing I would rush back for. It also was pretty poor value given the limited ingredients and small size.

Overall I've had much better sandwiches around town, much more reasonably priced, from people who were much more welcoming and passionate about their product.  I don't see myself returning anytime soon.

I don't know if that was even legal...but the owner explained to me that it was their policy on a busy Sunday, because after all they need to pay their bills.

This is is a great space in Gastown where it has a wonderful patio in addition to a fairly large indoor space.  I love the atmosphere... modern and zen.   Lots of light woods, white gleaming spaces, and matte blacks.  It was pretty busy during a lunch time but everyone was fairly quiet... a lot of people working on laptops and enjoying a coffee or a light lunch.  Personally, I was about the coffee and that case filled with one of the best looking pastries in the city.  I was floored when they said they did everything in house... most coffee spots get them trucked in.

Flat White - While I really enjoyed my flat white for the flavour... I'm sure this wasn't a true flat white.  Though the microfoam was fairly well... there was a lot... like latte cappuccino which is ok.  People dont always get the right balance.

That being said, this is a 3.5 star review for this pho spot in Vancouver. Which is pretty generous considering my extensive pho background. Service was good but the food wasn't quite as flavorful as I'm used to.

I went with a basic order of *Pho Tai* (flank steak noodle soup). Unfortunately the broth was a bit bland, but it satisfied my craving for noodle soup since I was feeling a little under the weather. The *Iced Coffee*, which is Vietnamese style coffee made with condensed milk, tasted a bit off too. Maybe it was the the type of condensed milk or the coffee wasn't a French roast.

212,"3.5 stars ... it's a very good option for anyone who has to find breakfast at a god forsaken hour.  Service is 4 stars even when the sun hasn't full risen.  

I'm normally not an advocate for hotel restaurants but one super early morning, I needed to find breakfast that wasn't some subpar fast food drive thru.  Forage popped up as a nice local favourite that opened early and seemed reasonably priced for the downtown core.  I can see why there is a fair amount of love for this place because every wait staff was just so friendly even before 7 am.

Their breakfast menu is simple with a strong focus on locally sourced ingredients to build out the dishes.  Its a farm to table concept that has been done and I find Forage executes it well quickly and quietly.  Though there wasn't a seafood option on the breakfast menu... I did see a Oceanwise nod on their dinner menu.  Sustainable farming for our ocean is always greatly appreciated by me.

So the service here was super quick on the coffee pours and keeping them filled and hot.  With a really pleasant hello, the staff was able to rhyme off the best dishes and help pick something for me to help keep me full as I made my way up the Sea to Sky.  I have to admit that the staff goes beyond the usual service.  I noticed the couple beside me eating breakfast and I have to assume they're patrons of the restaurant.  Within minutes of entering, they already engaged in lively and cute banter with every staff member.  Every staff was more than happy to pause their busy day with just a few moments to make this elderly couple from London feel a bit more welcomed.  I would have loved to chat with everyone but I didnt have my coffee yet.  

Foragers omelette - I absolutely loved how Forage allowed some items to be swapped out.  I didnt need the 4 slices of toast the omelette came with so they gave a large dish of berries instead.  PERFECT.  That just made me really appreciate them that much more.  The omelette was fairly well cooked with it not being overcooked and it had goat cheese and mushrooms inside.  They had more than just plain button mushrooms ... I saw oysters and perhaps another Japanese one.  Either way, it was a tasty start to my morning.  They did have the addition of breakfast potatoes.  Of all the components on the plate, I felt the potatoes were just a tad too soft.  I'm a big crunchy potato fan so it was a bit underdone in my opinion.  3.5 for the dish with a bonus of 0.5 cause of the berry swap.  4/5

Eggs, bacon, sausage, and potatoes - This was decent dish ... I dont think you could dress up the breakfast classic too much.  The eggs were cooked to the right sunny side up.  Bacon and sausage was decent.  I dont think they were bad at all but nothing about their flavour or cooking made them stand out to be exceptional or eye catching.  It could have used perhaps some hot sauce but this was a solid dish to wake up to.  3.5/5

To me, the atmosphere is quite nice and serene for a morning start and the staff is just great.  Really nice and super quick on everything... they stand out.

Panaderia is a little slice of food heaven. On one side you have a mini supermarket with Latin spices, ingredients, and treats, and then on the other side you have the bakery where you can order a variety of Latin goods to go. 

The empanadas are  a must! I recommend both the chicken and the beef. If you aren't a meat eater, the spinach and cheese one is also divine. The empanada crust is buttery, flaky, and melts right in your mouth, which I love. The real treat for me though is the Brazilian pastels, which is basically a rectangular shaped fried pastry stuffed with meats and cheeses. It is heavenly. My arteries may not thank me, but my taste buds sure do.

I think it's a tempered French accent... not Quebecois cause he can actually enunciate words.  

Fable sits on 4th Avenue near Kitsilano Beach.  The dining room itself is quite dim as it sits receded back into the space.  The front section has their open kitchen with all it's glorious smells spilling into the streets.  Though it is very dim, you can still make out the room which is whimsical with it's decor notes from a farm.  The lighting fixtures are pickforks and the walls are exposed bricks with lots of warm golden woods everywhere.  The rooster is found in different spots around the room in addition to standing proudly on their sign.  I have to give thanks to Fable for not cramming in the tables to the point you're sitting on another person.  It's a popular spot as we saw the room always at 90% capacity but I couldnt hear my neighbours conversation all the time.

As I mentioned, the service here was just great.  The gentleman was warm, personable with stories of the dishes, and just enthusiastic. He always had a way of making us laugh with his super dry delivery and then hit you with this infectious giggle at the end.  You had to just smile back.  On top of being just a great person to talk to... he had really wonderful ways to describe each dish.  He clearly had a passion and favourites.  We followed all his suggestions and we were rewarded with a phenomenal night.

Crispy Chickpeas fritters - Dinner kicked off with these crunchy fritters that held a tender and almost fluffy interior.  The curry mayo pops the flavour up with the spices while the pickled onion cuts through creamy curry with a bright bold sweet and acidic kick.  I just loved this as a starter. 4.5/5

Octopus salad - This was their seasonal daily offering and I think they should keep this on the menu.  The plating was pretty but hiding under the wreath of endive, you'd find the plumpest and crispy pork belly pieces with the perfectly charred tender octopus.  How could they get both components so perfectly crispy charred with still keeping everything so supple and delicious to tear into it. On top of those 2 amazing things, they also had the added elements of potato rosti croutons.  This is just really amazing crispy potato shreds in a cube form. Then they top it off with a delicious sauce of cauliflower honey mustard.  You have smokey, meaty, a touch of sweetness, and a kick of spiced heat from the mustard.  Just a great dish.  I could have eaten more of this.  5/5

Charred Beets - Simple vegetables elevated ... I'm not sure how they made this so smokey but that added flavour element kept this from being a boring salad.  The smokiness reminded me of the best smoked ribs in a BBQ.  The heavier char taste was nicely contrasted by the tangy smooth goat cheese and the fresh herbal sauce.  At the end, the natural sweetness of the beets come through.  It's definitely one of the better beet preparations I've had. 5/5

Smoked Duck Breast with carrots done 4 ways - I think its cute but there's a smiley face on the plate for this duck breast.  I think it's very happy it was cooked at Fable cause this was another great dish.  This particular duck was done nicely to medium rare so it had that nice ruby shade inside.  It was juicy and had a right gamey rich meat flavour that goes beyond your regular chicken.  The accompaniment of carrots was so interesting.  It was pureed (creamy and naturally sweet), roasted (tender with some good savour flavour from roasting... it almost tastes like chicken fat), pickled (bright and punchy from the vinegar), and raw shredded (for that nice crunch).  On top of all this there was a sharp caraway mustard seed sauce that paired with it.  Another great dish that I could happily eat again.  5/5

Rhubarb berries goat cheesecake - At this point I was ready to call it quits but the gentleman was kind enough to explain how delicious their desserts were.  With the words of ""rhubarb and fresh berries"" uttered, I was sold.  I like a light fresh tart and berry flavour so this was a perfect end.  The creamy goat cheese cake was a nice base for the hazelnut praline.  The praline so good with its sweet, crunchy, nutty, and a wonderful flavour of caramel.  The cherries were added as a gelee which was a wonderfully concentrated pop of flavour as you had some of the tart rhubarb.  Fresh blueberries were added just in case you didnt have enough fresh berry flavour already.  4.5/5

Fable has a lot of fans in Vancouver and it's completely deserving.  It was the best restaurant I went to during my trip and a stand out with it's interesting use of local ingredients and possibly one of the better service experiences in a while.  Definitely make reservations... you won't be sorry.",Positive,Moderate,Reasonable

Saray was a small spot out in Burnaby on Willingdon that was ok, but had a very small kitchen and couldn't do much in the space.  The owner sold and relocated to this new location in Vancouver with a full kitchen, and I'm glad he did!  

They just opened yesterday, and don't have the full menu available yet, but I couldn't resist the kuzu sis (lamb skewers). I'm a sucker for good lamb, so I had to try it out.  The plate was $13.99.

They plated a beautiful selection of salads, along with rice, freshly made bread and a lengthy lamb skewer.  The lamb was perfectly cooked at a nice medium rare.  It was caramelized on the edges with a slight smokiness and extremely juicy and tender inside. Very very VERY nice job on the lamb.  The roasted bell pepper, pickled cabbage salad, roasted tomato, and pickles rounded out the dish giving different textures and flavours with every bite.  Even the bread was a treat - very fresh with a pleasant chewiness.  

This was a very enjoyable lunch, in a casual but comfortable setting with a tablecloth and fresh flower on the table. They even have a little traditional sitting area that they seem to plan to use for dinner time.

I'm looking forward to seeing how they do, and am looking forward to returning soon to try the full menu!",Undefined,Moderate,Reasonable

Welcome to the extended home of Tamam and Sobhi, the owners of Tamam. When one thinks of Palestine, most people think of political strife and unrest.  Food and Palestinian culture aren't what you typically think about....and that is exactly why Tamam and Sobhi opened this special place.  To share the beauty of their culture through food. 
On the night we dined, there was a large family of Palestinians eating at a table nearby. Always a good sign.....and yes, the food was tasty and delicious. My favorite thing was the kibbeh. Hot, crunchy full of nuts and spiced beef. SO good with a squeeze of fresh lemon. We also really loved the steel head trout-full of juices served with a light creamy lemon sauce.  Four olive, rice and meat filled cabbage rolls and a vinegared cabbage salad came on each plate (multiple choices for sides were offered).  The lamb was fork tender and was served with similar choices. For dessert we enjoyed a rose water infused rice pudding topped with Creme and pistachios.

We also got the Lemongrass Chicken and Grilled Pork on Rice with Fried Egg plate, too. Most of it came home with us because there was nooooo way we could eat all of this and drink a few beers.

I have 2 memories that have reverberated in my mind from vacationing in Vancouver, Canada.  I've already forgotten much of what we did (my memory is horrible.)  But I do remember two things:

1. Vancouver has crap loads of Chinese, many very wealthy.  Bentley's are everywhere, and the poorer folks gotta drive their crappy BMW's and Mercedes'.  Feel bad for those lower class folks.

and...

2. To go along with #1: Chinese food there is AMAZING.

This restaurant has got to be one of the best dim sum's I've had this side of the world.  And trust me, I've been to some of the best in America, having lived in SoCal for most of my life.

It really doesn't look like much from the outside.  Fairly typical strip-mall looking exterior.  Inside, a quarter football field packed full of yacking Chinese.  It was so packed, we had to wait about an hour to get a table.

But the food,... holy cow.  Everything more juicy, more bigger, more flavorful, and consistently more special than other places.  For instance, the sticky rice had wild black rice mixed in (my friends said that's typical for dim sum in Vancouver though.)  Steamed ribs were extra meaty, the glass noodles were especially chewy and delicious (and I typically hate glass noodles), tripe was extra super flavorful, and...... even the bean curd was extra silky.

I dunno if my friends who live here consider this restaurant their best... I'm guessing probably not.  I wouldn't be surprised if Vancouver has dozens of dim sum restaurants at least this awesome.

But I don't care!  I LOVED the food here!  Service sucked crap of course, but well, if it didn't it wouldn't be authentic.

When coming to Vancouver, you MUST try Japadog! I couldn't wait to get my tush off that airplane and FINALLY arrive at my hotel. (I made sure to stay at a hotel that was walking distance from a Japadog, and trust me-I was 500 ft. from one!). HAHA! Yes, Japadog is better than your normal ""Hotdog stand"". They jazzy up that dog and put some delicious toppings on it and the BEST part about it...They are Cheap and fill you up!! 

Japadog is a one-of-a-kind hot dogs creations and serve some of the BEST flavors!

-#1 Kurobutta Terimayo $7.00

They have tons of locations and I also seen that they have a location in Santa Monica! I don't know how good they are, but if they are ANYTHING like the stands in Vancouver, then I know they are damn good! 

QUICK TIP-They only do cash only; however, they also accept US cash. I love that! 
It's not a big stand; they only have one register per stand so the wait can be a little long (but its totally worth it!).

The Art of Spice (the previous restaurant in this spot) had promise when it opened up, but then it went downhill.

RV's Butter Kitchen just opened in the spot, and it again shows promise. I hope it has more of a positive path than Art of Spice did.

The menu is filled with a variety of classic Indian dishes as well as some creative menu items catering to a more fusion type of target such as ""Sexy fries"" (Indian inspired poutine) as well as various ""burritos"" (butter chicken, lamb tikka, or veggie wrapped in naan instead of tortilla). They clearly put some effort into making a creative menu.

To get a feel for the cooking, I tried out the Deluxe Vegetarian Thali ($9.99) that provided very good value and offered a chance to try a wide variety of their dishes. There was a nice variety of offerings with generous portions. 

The vegetable pakora was perhaps the highlight of the thali. It was freshly fried, perfectly crisp on the outside with a more tender centre. It had a good balance of spicing overall. 

The naan was properly made, nicely bubbled with a good char. It had a good chew as well. 

The dal was of the darker variety and gently spiced. I liked the consistency. The vegetable offering was nicely spiced, with a mix of fresh and frozen veggies as well as some paneer cubes. It was simple, but did the job. The raita was plentiful and provided a cooling contrast.  The salad was simple lettuce and onions with a single slice of cucumber. The papadum was a folded over variety (folded into quarters), nicely spiced and crunchy. The galub jamun ended the meal with another highlight. It too tasted freshly prepared, being warm and gently soaking in the sweetness without being sickly sweet. Very nice job on this. They also include complimentary masala chai that was well balanced.

Overall for a quick lunch this was very good value, and I look forward to returning for a dinner to try some of the more novel offerings on their menu.

224,"Now, that's a spicy fish bowl!

There have been lots of dishes and cuisines I've missed since living in Asia and Southern California ... like the extremely spicy lip-numbing heat of Sichuan flavors. High on the list is ????????? (Shui Zhu Yu) which is called ""Fish Fillet in Hot & Spicy Gravy"" ($14.95) at Szechuan Brothers. 

I don't care if they call it Freakishly Fiery Flaming Fish Fillet or just the Michael Special (extra spicy), because I'm so overjoyed to find something close to authentic (although still not spicy enough) Sichuan spiciness in Vancouver.

Szechuan Bros has other versions which I must try, but the simple joy of eating boneless white fish swimming in a bowl of liquid red heat with bean sprouts and cabbage was the perfect fire for a cold winter night.

After one visit, we have a long list of other dishes to try ... and that's especially remarkable since we actually really liked all five we had in our first meal here including:

 * ????????? Dan Dan Szechuan Noodles ($8.95)
   More filling than fabulous

 * ????????? Yang Rou (Lamb) Skewers ($4.95)
   Only 3 to an order ... so order more and extra cumin

 * ???????????? Fried Pork Spare Ribs with Sizzling Rice ($15.95)
   Bite-size house-special crispy pork still on the bone 

 * ???????????? Mixed Beef with Spicy Sauce ($10.95)

Tips for my next visit:
 * Get the Brother's Spicy Margarita ($10) again & again & again
 * Ask them to pump the spice up to 11
 * Try the ??????????????? Fish with Sour Preserved Vegetables
 * Try the ????????????????????? House Special Fish Fillet
 * Save room for dessert
 * Plan to keep exploring the menu

The only real knock I have against Szechuan Brothers is that the prices are so much higher than you'll find in Southern California or Sichuan (of course) for even better (and much spicier) dishes; however, I'm still a huge fan and plan to be back soon (and often) to satiate my search for sensational Sichuan spices and seasoning.",Undefined,Undefined,Expensive
225,"Yelpers love noods.
 
Tasteful noods. 
Exotic noods.
Famous noods. 
Even fake noods.

Yelpers also love to share pics of beautiful noods as we're online checking out noods, noods, noods ... A LOT. So, discovering the popular Noodle Bar (near the Vancouver Mall) was kind of inevitable.

The open inviting space of the restaurant is a comfortable place for noods. We quickly walked up to the counter to place our order ... including a Yelp Check-in Deal of a FREE Thai Iced Tea to sip while savoring the noods.

However, before focusing on the noods, we split a seductive appetizer of 5 Noodle Bar Chicken Wings ($8) with a handful of Celery Sticks. They're advertised as one the Noodle Bar's signature items thanks to a secret sauce and I have to admit I totally forgot about the noods while enjoying the wings.

That is until the noods came out. First was a plate of hot Pad Kee Mao Noodle Stir Fry with Pork ($8.50) that was as stimulating as any noods I've seen in a while. To pump up the heat, I spiced the noods with some hot sauce and sliced peppers from the jars on the table. These were some hot noods for sure!

Unfortunately, the other noods didn't stimulate my wife or I in a positive way. we were both turned off by a bowl of Yen Ta Fo Noodle Soup ($10.25). The thin pink broth had a weird sour taste despite shrouding some tempting thick noods. We definitely won't be looking for these noods again in the future.

So, basically, my advice for The Noodle Bar is to spend time with the noods that you're comfortable with and don't get distracted by noods that turn you off. If you go, remember this poem.

Roses are red.
Violets are blue.
Send noods ...

I really like Tasty out in Surrey. So I was excited to see it opening up in Yaletown.

The non-veg lunch special ($16) offered a nice variety of basic dishes, so I tried it out. The tandoori chicken was not well marinated and tasted rather bland when getting past the skin to the inside. The skin itself did not have that slightly smoky taste you'd expect from a nicely executed tandoori chicken. A bit disappointing.  Similarly the naan was rather bland, felt like it had been rolled by a machine instead of hand done, and didn't have any decent char. The rice was nicely decorated, but again slightly bland. The butter chicken had tender pieces of breast meat in a rather standard sauce. The dahl was the highlight as it had good flavours, was well seasoned, had nice fresh slices of ginger for a bit of a punch.

Overall a pretty disappointing and bland meal considering how good their Surrey location is.  

I hope they get this location up to that standard, but if today is any indication I don't have high hopes for this being anything other than a high priced rather standard Indian restaurant with nice decor instead of really high quality on the food execution.",Neutral,Moderate,Expensive

I was dismayed when several years ago one of my favourite spots for xiao long bao (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/wangs-shanghai-cuisine-burnaby?hrid=a1JVxwFA3ExuYStiJrF4Ow&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)) closed down.  It was a loss for us all.  

So you can imagine my surprise when I stumbled onto a new restaurant with the exact same name many years later.

Instead of being a stall in a food court, it is now a ""full"" restaurant.  I put the full in quotes, because it is a very small space with about 7 tables total. But they do have table service.

I didn't recognize any of the faces, but couldn't see into the kitchen, so I wasn't sure if it was the same people running it.  But after ordering the xiao long bao ($4.75 for 6) it seems like it is likely the same dumpling maker, or at least the same recipe.  Wang's was the only place I've been where the ginger was not served sliced in the vinegar and instead put inside of the meat mixture to steam into the dumpling directly.  And this new Wang's did the same thing.  Is that a ""signature ginger move"" or something?!?!?!?

The xiao long bao arrived piping hot with steam visibly rising from the steamer.  The skins were a bit thicker than I remember them, and the tops were a bit sloppily pinched instead of neatly folded as I remember them.  Even though they were crammed into the steamer and slightly touching none of them stuck to each other and all came out without breaking at all.  The pork and broth were as I remember them.  Steaming the ginger directly inside layers the flavours in a very pleasing way, and they were bursting with the impactful broth.  Photos:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/wangs-shanghai-cuisine-vancouver?select=qEDUtAZ96QcKJ0XOMR6Ixw and http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/wangs-shanghai-cuisine-vancouver?select=kr8hlnfVC6aQKzBve5qPhw

I looked at the dishes other people were ordering (you get crammed into a table with lots of strangers at busy times like when I was there) and I have to say that the other menu items looked of varying quality to me.  I saw one stir fried pork dish where the pork looked extremely overcooked visually. So time will tell what dishes are the good ones to get here.

my initial instincts and just ""avoid"".  But perhaps I can save someone else from bothering?

We had just a short wait for brunch, and while we wanted to sit outside, we had to take an indoor table. It seemed odd as an outside table was almost certainly available. It would not have taken much for them to accommodate us, and I needed some fresh air after recovering from illness. But nope, they did not seem to know how to accommodate seating, so right from the beginning something was a bit ""off"". 

The server seemed friendly at first, until we were served our dishes without an offer of salt and pepper or anything else at that. Call me crazy, but I like my egg to have a bit of seasoning. We finally flagged her down for the salt and pepper which was conveniently hidden but not far away enough for her to have ignored it in the first place. Only then did I learn that my soft boiled egg was completely cold on the outside. Call me crazy again, but isn't soft boiled usually at least luke warm, because otherwise it's hard, right? I had to argue with my server over why breakfast eggs are generally warm and she defensively obliged and  brought me another one. It was all very odd. 

Of course, by that time I had nothing else
with which to eat my egg and my friends had finished their meals. So then I was stuck eating my egg, solo, and with no bread to lap up the goodness.

The rest of my dish and friends' dishes were certainly delicious, and of course, since I was the one with the problem, I was ignored thereafter. I did not expect them to comp my eggs, but I know any classy place would have offered because that's how it's done and that's how good places stay in business! 

Instead, I was made to feel as if it was my fault that I was served a cold egg and service with the same type of lukewarm reaction.

This is in the location that used to be Jonker Street (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/jonker-street-restaurant-vancouver#hrid:8ontRzKIUq7OqIJlz7cW4Q).  I don't know if it is the same owners, but I recognized some of the staff.  If it is the same owners, I don't know what the owners were thinking when they re-branded as Fresh Bowl.  If it is new owners, I still don't get it.  I'm guessing it has to do with the Olympics or something - but bad changes!  

They took a sit down restaurant and turned it into a ""Southeast Asian"" fast food place with sit-down pricing (Jonker Street was always priced on the higher side for Malaysian food in Vancouver, and they seem to have maintained the prices).  The majority of items are now served as rice bowls (I saw some being served in plastic bowls but I hit the jackpot and got a ""real"" bowl).  Instead of real forks and spoons you get plastic, served on a plastic tray with paper napkins.  The bowls range from about $11-$16.  Hello?!?!?!?!

I ordered the beef rendang bowl, which was $12.  You get a choice of brown rice or ""jambori"" rice (which you may remember from the old Jonker Street).   The beef comes in a bowl on top of the jambori rice (basically a blend of jasmine, basmati, and some wild red), and a bunch of random fresh veggies like sliced bell pepper, carrots, and bean sprouts.  It is almost like a salad bowl with a bit of beef on the side to mix in.  I don't really get the concept.

I was a bit worried when they brought the tray with the plastic fork and spoon, as well as a knife.  Knife?  I thought for a second, ""Do they think the meat will need a knife?""  Sadly it did.  The beef would not break apart with a spoon and fork.  To say it was less than tender would be WAY too kind.

We arrived just before 6, and just in time for oyster happy hour, but when I asked about the said happy hour, the waiter was particularly apathetic and would not honour the deal. So much for the buck a shuck oysters. This was not a great way to start the night, especially since I'm accustomed to the friendly, accommodating happy hour service throughout pretty much every city and state in the US. I suppose this was representative of what I've come to know as Vancouver's non-existent happy hour.

The place was scarcely 1/3 full, which made it pretty obvious that they were still quite new. If you know Rodney's, you'll know that they are always packed, especially during a Friday happy hour. But since they don't even show up as a new business on Yelp just yet, it's only a matter of time before one discovers them, I guess. 

We ordered a variety of BC coast and a few Washington state oysters at $2.50 a pop shucked with skill and served with detailed explanations. That part was great, and although I've imbibed in their oysters before, it's always nice to receive a reminder. My fave were the two different medium sized oysters and of course, they were served with their great array of sauces ranging from mild to scorch-your-mouth on fire.

Crabcakes to share were slightly more rubbery and slightly more disappointing than I'd remembered from the original YT Rodneys, but still passable; they were served with a refreshing salad and were a good sized meal. Amazing new England clam chowder laden with (I don't even want to know how much butter and cream) was rich but delish.

I'm sure that soon it will take off and be just as packed as the Rodney's in YT (and the original is in YYZ).

Perfect. I ordered coffee, which was brought IMMEDIATELY to me by a very nice, friendly, and courteous young lady named Allison. I ordered the Pigs in a Blanket, my fav every time I visit here, now here's the really cool part.....it's not on the menu, it's a discontinued menu item. Not only is it made for me EVERY-TIME I dine here special request, but Allison remembers the sides I like with it!!!!! Three thick and fluffy pancakes, wrapped around lean sausage links, with a side of the crispiest bacon, and a bowl of Apple Sauce. PERFECTION!!!!!

236,"The space looks nice, and the food is what you expect from Del Taco.  That is to say its a small step up from Taco bell.   They have lots of specials in the evening.

My grip is service.  I am averaging eating her half the time I come here to eat.    I have stood for long periods of time at the front of the line,  without being even greeted,  much less helped.    While the staff played with their phones,  chats and wanders around.   

One of these visits I had got a call just after I arrived.  I had walked up to the front of the line with no one at the counter.  No one ever even said hi to me.  I checked  my phone when I climbed into my car, unhealed, It was 26 minutes after the call.

Steamed Korean dumplings were good. The ginseng chicken soup lacks ginseng,  so that can be skipped. The Korean side dishes are served on one dish-kimchi, potatoes, and seaweed. Servers are willing to give you more as you request.

Is it kooky that I liked the Banh Mi with Chashu Pork and Vietnamese Ham (3.5 stars) and Tempura Crispy Green Beans (3.5 stars) the most at Kooky Chicken. Otherwise, the classic fast food favorites were kooky.

The Kooky Burger was a plain ... too plain ... hamburger (2 stars) while the Kooky Fried Chicken (2 stars) was greasy on the outside and dry on the inside. I know, kooky, right?

The worst orders were the Waffle Sticks (1.5 stars) that are small frozen impressions of what a waffle could be and bitter over-cooked Fried Chicken Gizzards (1 star). I'd be kooky if I ordered either again.

239,"The Guu family is a pioneer of Japanese izakaya experiences in Vancouver with this particular joint focused on the glory that is garlic, an aroma that will ooze out of your pores long after you are finished with dinner. This is the kind of place where you can get anything you want, as long as what you want is garlic.

The tuna tataki is the thing to order if the rave reviews are to be believed, sashimi-style seared albacore tuna that comes with a side of ponzu sauce to add some zip and contrast. Slightly seared tuna and crispy garlic chips do just fine on their own, but the dip adds a decent kick that's salty, bitter, sweet, and sour all at once.

The king salmon tataki is the superior dish, richer, more decadent, and more robust than the tuna version. This gets topped with a Kanzuri ponzu jelly that adds both contrasting taste and texture, brought together by a sesame dressing with the right balance of sweet and salty.

The eggplant marinated in garlic and soy sauce is excellent, featuring a stir-fry of chopped eggplant cubes, tender with a still-structured texture within the sauce and accompanying ingredients. Though the taste is mild to start, it features a kind of salty after bite that lingers.

The Yaki-Udon is a dish that Paula Deen would love, a poetic plate of yellowy, thick pan-fried udon with beef, mushrooms, and green onion swimming in butter. Sometimes flavorless, udon in the hands of an expert can be delicate, yet rich, and the texture is firmly perfect. Guu's preparation is solid all around and includes beef and mushrooms that are tender and full of flavor.

Fried garlic chips are layered on everything in astonishing quantity, thin-sliced little slivers of heaven that help add an extra nutty, crispy, garlicky crunch. Great for us, bad for everyone else in the metro Vancouver area. You can wash down your food with a pitcher of sake mojito that pairs with every course, light and fragrant and pretty much the only thing here that's not thoroughly filled, topped, infused, or prepared with garlic.

Guu with Garlic is a homey place and, if it's early, there might be seating available, but as the night goes on, a line will form out the door, where there's a stench that lets everyone know what they're eating inside. During peak hours, a time limit of two hours on tables helps guarantee some turnover for the poor schmucks waiting outside. You can't go wrong with some delicious Japanese-style tapas from this place, especially with friends so that you can order a bunch of stuff and then marinate in toxic garlicky fumes together.",Undefined,Moderate,Reasonable
240,"Well now who could have predicted the year 2020 going like that!??

All I can say is - begone now please!!!

I could go on but enough of that rubbish year!

Is this truly a new year as in fresh start ... or actually just part 2? Yikes I sure hope not!?!

2021 here we go with the first one as in - review!

Put the rose coloured glasses away people - we need to see how things go in the first half of the year before we get excited & even then I'm thinking 2022 is the actual breakthrough year cause gosh - this coronavirus is deadly & the numbers are not good right now!

Only my second time here & it's been about a minute since the last time!

Might turn out to be the last time out for awhile - strong chatter on the news about further lockdowns/restrictions due to that bloody bat!

Was contemplating Miku but choose to go with Minami.

No matter as they are sister restaurants so it comes down to location I guess & the fact that Jay Z & Beyonc?? dinned at Miku when they popped into Vancouver for - On the Run II, if that sways your decision any.

I had briefly stopped by Minami last summer to check out their Happy Hour menu but ended up at another spot that July afternoon.

The bright sunny day pics you see here, were taken then just to give you an idea what Minami is like during the day.

Minami is a classy, elegant & upper crust Japanese sushi spot indeed I do say! 

I'll admit that I ain't no Sushi Sensei & have a strong leaning towards drowning my sushi in soy sauce mixed with a heavy dose of wasbi!

Who doesn't just love that 'hit' on the sinus after every bite of wasabi!?!

Nor am I a fan of Sashimi (too raw for me) - I know the horror!

Well now to my shock - Minami will tell you to try their sushi as is without sauce or wasabi (not even sure if it's offered) - & wow voila the magic of their Aburi (flame-seared) Sushi will hit the roof of your mouth & explode!!!

OMG so much paradise in every bite!

It was after just 1 bite that I realized I didn't need my beloved soy or wasabi at all!!! 

I was shocked at how good the sushi was without it!

I started wondering ... have I been eating sushi the wrong way all these years!?? 

Minami is spot on with tasty delicious sushi that hits all the right points - beauty check, presentation check, portion check, quality check & finally - taste check check check!

It ain't Cheap but it's worth it every now & then to - treat yourself rite!!!

Located in popular Yaletown (I've written & taken many pics of this neighbourhood - peruse my page at your leisure) Minami is a hit amongst locals & visitors. 

Presentation is key here & what a show of food indeed!!! See my pics!

What you see will have you oohing & aahing - I just couldn't wait to eat it all up!

We had the Red Wave Roll (crab, avocado, tuna), & the Champagne Roll (scallop, sockeye, cucumber, Miku sauce), & the Salmon Oshi (wild sockeye salmon, jalapeno & Miku sauce).

My M3 cocktail (Havana club 7, ginger liqueur, basil syrup, lime, mango foam) rocked!

Bartender hit me up one more time please!

Minami strives for excellence so if you are not satisfied - speak up as you're paying top dollar for no BS!

Minami is great for date nights & special occasions.

People please be safe out there & let's get through 2021 together!

Mask up!

I knew it would be good but it was above & beyond!!! Wow!!!!!

Goodness gracious folks right from the first bite - it all went down - in a positive way!!!

This HH is at par with Coast (see my review) & definitely in the top 3 of Vancouver HH's!!!

Ok so let's get into it ... the Steak Tartare nearly put me on the floor in convulsions - friggin amazing taste!

The Chinois Prawns came with a twist - a walnut on each one! Again - wow!!!

The Burrata & Prosciutto - another must have for HH! The fig jam & Dijon along with pickles - absolutely delicious!

242,"On our second night in Vancouver, we wanted something with a warm broth since the weather was a bit chilly.  I stumbled upon this hotpot restaurant via Yelp.  As soon as we walked in, we were greeted and escorted to a table.  The restaurant is quite small. There are only table seating and no booths.  
 
Our server was quick and attentive.  We both went with the hotpots.  First you select a bone broth, protein, rice included, noodles (extra charge), choice of dipping sauce and free beverage (iced lemon green tea).  

*Upgrade to bubble tea (2.99 extra). Add ons such as tofu, spam, mushrooms, seasonal greens, and Chinese donuts are also extra.  

We ordered::  
2 hotpots ~tonkotsu (Pork) broth with Alberta beef. Very savory and flavorful.  

Included ~tofu, enoki mushrooms, fish/shrimp balls, veggies and imitation crab sticks.  

I enjoyed sipping on the delicious soup broth.  This meal hit the spot and warmed me up.  Great local spot to have some Taiwanese hotpot!",Neutral,Good,Expensive
243,"So ... just a fair warning to anyone coming here.  Though this spot is so beautiful and wonderfully done. It sits on the very edge of where the East Hasting is often warned to tourist and where it starts going to a look like most west end Vancouver.  My experience probably would have been much better if I wasn't for some of the concerns smothering the positives.

The space is quite nice... it feels like a Scandinavian minimalist did up a cozy cottage.  Lots of woods but painted black or white.  Lots of white tiles, angles, and edges.  It's crisp but there's an underlying comfort in it.  There are lots of tables of all types so you can sit and work.  Service here was quick and efficient as they seem to work the morning crowd pretty quickly.

The concern is not the coffee... it's the location.  For starters, parking is not easy and though it's at the edge of East Hasting, it doesn't always feel like it.  For someone who lives and breathes Vancouver, this probably is normal.  But for visitors, it's a stark contrast to other cities.  I saw a needle on the sidewalk in addition to literal crap smeared across the sideswalks.  In addition to that, the people walking about are not ... well.  They didnt appear to be too aggressive but some didnt seem to appreciate our presence or anyone who was not in the same situation as them.  They were inside the cafe as well and they're deserving to be there as a paying customer.  But it was clear some homeless girls were hiding out in there because they didnt feel comfortable outside.  It's just not a feel good story.  Prado handled this as best they could ... it's just sad.

Flat White -  For starters, they use the popular Parallel 49 and I felt they actually did a better job than Parallel 49 on using the same beans.  I still unfortunately found this quite acidic bordering towards astringent tart.  I'm not sure what it is but after drinking several other places using Parallel 49 and other micro roasters in Vancouver... these beans are not my preference.  3.5/5

Overall, I want to say it's a chill and pretty place but the atmosphere was far from it.  It wasn't comfortable and it wasn't the coffee shop fault exactly.  Looking at other reviews, it seems my experience seems to be anomaly perhaps.",Positive,Moderate,Undefined
244,"This is a posh little breakfast/brunch eatery near the Westin Bayshore and it is a easy peasy two minute walk over from the hotel. You do get partial ocean views from some of the seating in the area, but I thought it was cooler to sit near the fire place further into the restaurant. This place looks like it used to be some kind of clothing store before it was converted into an eatery.

Menu items are exciting, the hubby and I went with two vanilla lattes and the avo bacon Mexican sandwich on a bagel creation as well as a breakfast burrito wrap.  The hubby loved his meal, and mine reminded me of a upscale mcgriddle from Mcdonalds. I think there was maple syrup drizzled all over it as my hands were super sticky after eating it which was annoying.  I think they were going for a Mexican type of vibe in my breakfast sandwich which I think was a miss as I couldn't taste any of those flavors mentioned in the menu but it was tasty. I think that menu items here are on the more Expensive side both of our dishes came out to about $15 each and the fruits that were placed onto our dishes were not the freshest, beware before you put them into your mouth. 

Service is attentive but a little over the top.  There were three servers in there and as soon as we sat down the first asked to take our drink order then the second asked and then the third. There appeared to be some type of communication breakdown here, and this happened also for checking up on us as well and taking our order.  We got a lot of attention but perhaps a bit too much for breakfast!

think again

since our server took 4ever 2 come back n take our order, we did a whole episode of debate live in wat we should order n the show lasted as long as the server coming back which was 15 mins.. we ended up ordering their Combo A which included

1) their noodle dish which contained thicker than spaghetti noodle that were handmade n super tender, but bland broth n delicious beef though;

2) Red Chicken which was different than any other chicken I ever had, as it had a unique texture that was pate like n came as a cold dish tasting like pate;

we also had:

3) dumplings boiled n they were decent, the pork filling was pretty lite, came w/ no sauce, so we used the sauce from the;

247,"Mamma Mia! That's a tasty pizza!

Pizzeria La Sorrentina may be my favorite food truck ... of all time. It's no joke. This mobile food cart features a fiery 900-degree wood-fired stone oven baking authentic Neopolitan pizzas. 

And those pizzas ... Che bello! ... because pizza napoletana is real pizza.

Neopolitan pizzas literally are the original Italian perfection that was modified a 100 years ago to create what we call New York pizza. Despite its tasty origins, pizza somehow devolved to Pizza Hut, Domino's, and then that abomination Little Caesar's sells. So, take a step back in time to a simpler and better pizza that features a soft thin crust and amazingly fresh ingredients.

It's pizza ... crafted and eaten the way the Roman god Edesia intended: basically, baked for 90 seconds and then devoured immediately.

And the coolest part of Pizzeria La Sorrentina may not even be the heavenly Neopolitan Pizzas because the man in the truck, Daisuke Matsumoto, is a true pizza god ... and his back-story may surprise you. He is originally from Japan, but developed a passion for making real pizzas while living and working in Sorrento, Italy (hence the name Pizzeria La Sorrentina). 

Somehow, he ended up in Vancouver, WA near Portland and made his dream come true of opening a food cart selling authentic Pizzas Napoletanas.

248,"This is not your typical mall ... it's more of a relic and a waning memorial of what a lively Asian mall could be like.  From the exterior, you'd expect more ... it looks fairly modern and built in the last 10 years.  It's kinda well maintained on the exterior but once you walk in, you realize... ugh, I've seen roadkill look more lively.

Majority of the stores are closed up... shuttered...empty as mother hubbard's cupboards.  Its quite depressing.  Only the dismal Starbucks and decently stocked Rexall Drug Store seem to be keeping this place alive.  The place isnt really clean... it looks like it needs a really good mopping and lysol.  Everything just look so gray and dusty.  

Of the stores actually stocked with something, only half of them were actually opened.  Most of the closed store looked to be some sort of Chinese or Asian art with a lot of vases, watercolour drawings, or some sort of stone carving.  They seemed to take up a lot of space but the lights are off.  

There is a foodcourt but Im going to be honest, everything looks dried out and stale.  Not a single operator looked up once to see who even walked about.  That being said... it's REALLY Cheap.  I was seeing prices for $5 for rice, meat, and drink.  You get what you pay for I guess.  

There were only 2 stores that were remotely interesting... one it Catfe the Cat Cafe.  I peered in and even the cats seemed to be bored and in hiding.  Reviews didnt look promising as it seemed to be overpriced drinks and you can't touch the cats if they're sleep... which seemed to be often.  The other spot was a bubble tea spot that seemed to be brewing things themselves in addition to doing soft serve ice cream.  Lots of interesting flavours and would have liked to try it if had any desire to come back here. 

It's kinda sad to see this be completely underused and not taken care of...  a vibrant Chinatown needs a hub of activity for food and selling the newest gimmicky trend.  This clearly has lost that edge completely and is just abiding time till a real developer takes hold of this spot and revitalize it... or bulldoze it.",Positive,Good,Cheap

250,"* Little? 2nd *

So Juke Fried Chicken, from Chinatown, has added a new location in the West End in Davie Village. They call it ""Little Juke"" and I suppose it is because of the size of the space (seating for only about 20), not because of the portion sizes.

They've also added a few new items to the menu in this location including rotisserie chicken and a ""Big Boy"" sandwich.  

The Big Boy ($10) came with a VERY generous and juicy chicken cutlet fried to perfection with a crispy coating and juicy tender meat inside. It was dipped into (or should I say slathered in) their spicy sauce (pleasantly spicy, but definitely not ""hot""), placed on top of a very creamy cole slaw, and served on a light fluffy bun.

Extra flavour bottles of spicy sauce and beer honey are on the table just in case. But it definitely didn't need it. 

This was not a small sandwich. It was big. It was messy. It was delicious.

If they ever open up a Big Juke I'll just run away scared.",Undefined,Moderate,Cheap
251,"3.5 stars ... App game is strong and their happy hour would probably be really good.

When I first planned Vancouver and looked up the best restaurants, Tuc Craft Kitchen was always the first one for scores and just sheer volume of people loving it.  There's a lot of good things going for it... it's in the nice part of Gastown which is just a great atmosphere.  Their menu takes advantage of BC's ability to provide some great produce and they have a nice craft beer listing available on top of their cocktail menu.

It's a fairly large space that spans 2 floors and reminds me more of an old industrial wing.  Large machinery and rough woods in mahogany tones lends the room a relaxed old school vibe that makes it a nice place to meet up with friends over drinks and apps.  The final touches of large metal chains on the bar really catches my eye.  The service here is warm and friendly.  It's never unprofessional but you definitely feel like you're talking to friends more than just the staff.  

The menu is simple but offers something for everyone.  It's most good ol' Canadiana but it does have a few nods to Asia which was interesting.  Their beer list holds a lot of local gems and leans heavily towards blondes and IPAs.  If you're not sure... ask.  Our server was very helpful to figure out which one we'd like best.

The Salad - For a simply named salad, I thought this was actually quite good and understates that even Carnivores would like.  Maybe they should rename it Carnivore salad.  First bite was a bit of love because of the creamy yogurt dressing just coating the vegetables enough to give is a light tartness but then the cured ham just brought a nice salty savouriness to the crunchier veg.  I'm all for being vegetarian some days but I do think a bit of meat just makes vegetables taste better.  The eggs were really well cooked as the yolk were just set and still giving you that golden glow.  4/5

Mussels & Sausage - A good sized helping of mussels but NOT ENOUGH BREAD to sop up all the sauce.  Is it wrong that I just want to want it all ... tomatoes, chilli, garlic, and sausage too?  Not a single mussel was bad and they were pretty plump.   The garlic was giving me that great pungent flavour.  Thank god I had a breath mint.  Tuc... Please add more bread. Four small baguette sized pieces is not enough.  4/5

Parsnip Fries - This is a bit novel... I've heard of regular potato, sweet potato, taro, blue potato even... but parsnip?  These were strong string cut and crispy.  Loved how they were properly salted without going overboard.  The homemade tomato sauce was a touch sweet for me but helped balanced the saltiness.  3.5/5

Four Star Tao  - Though the Ni??oise looked tempting, I was more thinking of supporting Mealshare and I ordered the Four Star Tao.  This is their vegetarian offering of tempura cauliflower with brussel sprouts, shiitake mushrooms, sugar snap peas, and red peppers.  I felt this missed the mark a bit on execution and flavour.  The tempura was heavy and dense and sopped up a lot of sauce which made it the texture of playdoh.  I liked the variety of vegetables but felt they were just cooked a little too long.  Everything was too soft and missed the right snap and crispness to a properly cooked vegetable.  Also the sauce was quite cloying and felt heavy handed with the corn starch... a little too much gelatinous in texture.  I love the idea of it though.  3/5

Lamb Shank - Fork tender and a generous portion of lamb arrived at the table and with a big bone sticking out, it makes you salivate a bit before taking a bite.  Unfortunately my first bite left me confused a bit... the chocolate demi sauce really didn't go with the lamb.  It was sweet and yet not.  Too heavy & rich without any acidity or brightness dish component to cut through it, and it had an unusual spice that was pungent and too earthy.  3/5

I did like the apps a lot more than the mains... I felt the flavours worked better and didn't get bogged down in heavy sauces.  I love how they support Mealshare and for Vancouver, it really seems it is necessary to help others.  Overall, come for drinks, good apps, and a nice easy going spot to relax with friends.",Positive,Moderate,Undefined

Midway of roaming about in Gastown, rain started to come down, so we decided to take cover somewhere. Just in time anyway, because although it was after 2pm, we hadn't eaten lunch yet.

The Flying Pig was only steps away from where we were so we walked over and put our name on the waitlist. It's a two level dining room with a kinda trendy and rustic appeal to it. The room was filled and we had about a 15 minute wait before we were seated on the second floor at a table with a great view.

Since we had already browsed the menu while we waited downstairs, we already knew that we were getting the Parmesan Breaded Chicken Cutlet and the T.F.P Pulled Pork Sandwich. Both of which were really good. The chicken was juicy and tender and it was lightly breaded and crispy on the outside. The sandwich I had looked ugly but it was really good!

I was hangry upon arrival and desperate to keep me sane, my boyfriend rushed to Yelp for some sort of savior.

The menu was simple allowing customers to customize their sandwich to their liking. I ended up getting the small capicollo with pesto mayo, mustard, Swiss cheese, most of the veggies (get the pickled eggplant) while the boyfriend opted for the mortadella with about the same ingredients except on a half focaccia. At the end they asked us if we wanted to make it panini style, in which I gladly obliged (after all, why add cheese without melting it all into gooey goodness!?)

Soon we had the sandwiches in hand and paid a nice price less than $20 for 2 hefty sandwiches. Though hefty, the sandwiches weren't oily which was a nice touch considering it had so many ingredients. The cheese melted down acted as a kind of glue to keep everything from falling out so it was an easy sandwich to chow down, especially considering they were both so darn delicious!

Located in the heart of Coal Harbour, this is the perfect place to sit, enjoy a fantastic breakfast {lunch and diner are served as well}, and take in the gorgeous scenery of the harbour and the Northshore.  

Upon entering, we were greeted immediately and able to choose our own table.  We chose a cozy spot on the second level right next to a faux fireplace & the best view of the open kitchen - Perfect setting to step out of the cold and enjoy a great breakfast!  

The staff at 6 Degrees was nothing short of fantastic - Friendly, outgoing and extremely knowledge about the menu {suggesting the perfect breakfast option for my husband}.

I opted for the Breakfast Wrap - Scrambled Eggs, Canadian Bacon, Spinach and Garlic Saut??ed Mushrooms all wrapped in a Whole Grain Tortilla - Delicious and Oh, so Filling!  Highly recommended!  My husband opted for the Bacon Bagel Friend Egg Avocado Sandwich {that name is a mouthful} - An ""Egg in a Hole"" concept - Canadian Bacon, a Sweet & Spicy mix of Chipotle and Paprika with Maple Syrup, served on a crispy Bagel with Tomato Guacamole and a Free Range Fried Egg - Man, Oh Man - This baby was delicious!

258,"Finally, was able to get in here after over an hour and 15 minute wait on a Saturday. Cute, albeit extremely loud transformation of an old, Vancouver Italian landmark that had been laid to rest. Now it must be the hottest place in town for veggies and meatatarians alike--no joke! 

Welcoming friendly hostess and waitress. Excellent food and portions were bigger than expected. While I certainly did not leave hungry, I was hungry three hours later which makes me think that it's time to return to my cavewoman carnivore roots. There's a reason that fire + spears were invented after all! But no matter, it's still a five, in spite of that ""never quite full"" feeling I get after going veggie for the night. 

Order for three gfs:

A bottle of Joie rose-if you haven't tried it it appeals to red + white wine lovers alike. A def. hit. I knew we were off to a great start. They offered us some seasoned peanuts that were just okay but a very nice touch. Still, we wanted to wait for the real food. 

Beets-Macadamia Cheese & Beet Ravioli, Grapefruit, Sorrel, Cider Glaze (GF / V / RAW Option) - $10 Beautiful presentation, refreshing. I tried to take photos but vintage iphone + an extremely dark atmosphere made me focus on the delicious taste. I was content to take photos with my eyes, instead. :) 

House-Made Ricotta Gnocchi, Rapini, Marinara Sauce - $12-delicious, pillowy goodness.

Beer Battered Halloumi (cheese)  Zucchini Pancake, Smashed Peas, Yogurt, Lemon Balm - $19.-seemed to be the hit of the restaurant. Absolutely yum and filling. Great to share! 

Desserts- (just ok) Pumpkin Semifreddo, Amaretti Crumble, Cr??me Fraiche, Sage Crisps - $9

Trail-mix-in-a-bar: Peanut Chocolate Peanut Terrine, Berries, Coconut Whip, Raspberry Coulis, Lemon Thyme, (GF / RAW / V) - $11 Slightly better. 

I love desserts and these were none too-heavy or sweet. But next time I think that I'd skip them entirely and just order another main. We actually couldn't finish two between us which was surprising. I'd def. give them a five star for presentation. 

Overall, a wonderful place to go with gfs; I'm not so sure if I'd take a hungry guy here, but there were definitely men dining in the restaurant. The vintage chairs of yore were not conducive for lounging, either. 

But... when I'm in the mood for veggie again, I'll definitely return; this time I'll arrive before six and maybe order the Haloumi just for me!",Positive,Good,Reasonable

You, like my tortured tongue, are probably wondering how, in the name of Kublai Khan, Yummy earns 2 stars instead of 1 and it is simply because it is Cheap AYCE food. It's hard to expect great quality (or a clean table) with a Groupon deal offering buffet and soda for 2 people for $17 total.

Of course, Mongolian barbecue isn't really Mongolian. According to Wikipedia, it's more a mix of Taiwanese and Japanese styles branded in way to conquer hordes of people.

261,"What a shame. This was once a world class sushi restaurant, if not a standard set for any other Japanese restaurant in Vancouver. 

Now? 

Well lets just say that if I wanted b-grade, pre-made, pre-rolled sushi I would buy a $10 bento box at the mall, not spend $200 per person on an Omakase sitting. For half the time, Tojo simply socialized while his minions brought out refrigerated trays of pre-made, pre rolled sushi platters from the kitchen, then had the arrogance to let his clientele sit watching as he merely placed these pre-made pieces of sushi on individual settings and present them as Omakase. 

And also bill you as such. 

A shadow of its former self, you know you have a problem when your sushi sat in the fridge longer than your beer. I came here often in the 2006-2008 era and brought clients left and right. We, everyone I took - loved this place. The fish quality, prep and presentation was top shelf and as such you didn't mind, even expected the high price at the end of the meal.  The last few years have clearly been way too kind to Tojo - but not his brand. Tojo quite obviously doesn't even need to pretend to try anymore, and can get away with using lower grade fish, pre-made sushi rolls and while doing so, also bill high prices to what appeared to be mostly uninformed tourists. 

Sadly, this comes at a cost. That being Tojo no longer has a great or even what I would consider a good Vancouver restaurant - but just a great tourist trap, rip off.

The restaurant is hidden in the a very quiet part of the West End just a few blocks from Lost Lagoon in Stanley Park.  The main dining room located in a half sunken ground floor of an apartment building is intimately and comfortably appointed.  It extends a warm welcome the moment you walk in.  Tonight was the first time we sat in the patio outside the restaurant nestled in a courtyard between 2 apartment buildings.  The quaint and quiet neighbourhoold with neighbours going by on their evening dog walks was a perfect setting for alfresco dining on a warm summer evening.  Let's just say it set the mood for us to come home to watch Am??lie.

My favourite dishes are fritto misto di mare and linguine vongole.  I could not get enough of the perfectly cooked pasta and the plump and juicy clams.  Service was friendly, attentive and very down to earth.  You can be in your smart dinner attire or as casual as in your shorts and flip flop and you'll have no problem feeling at home either way.

265,"* Get over yourself, it is just a sandwich! *

This place really rubbed me the wrong way.  Let's just say they make too much of a ""hubbub"" about themselves.  It is a simple sandwich shop that thinks it is much much more.  Let me explain.

- The menu consists of 5 types of basic simple sandwiches (pork, turkey chorizo, chicken, veggie, and prawn) and 4 types of typical sides (corn, quinoa salad, chips, cole slaw).  But the first thing they say to you is, ""Have you been before?  Let me explain to you how our menu works.""  It really isn't so complex that you have to make a big ""hubbub"" about it.  It is 5 types of sandwiches, and we have to pick which of the 5 we want.  Get over yourself.

- Oh, and a note to them, you can't call the ""veggie"" sandwich option a ""protein.""  Get over yourself.  

- The only complex thing about the menu is that they charge you 25 cents if you want to leave off one of their ""mandatory"" toppings (garlic sauce, romaine lettuce, cilantro, onions, and pickled jalapenos).  Charging to leave OFF an item?  Get over yourself.

- After waiting about 15 minutes for the sandwich to be prepared (jeeze it wasn't crowded and you make all the sandwiches the same except for the protein, and you serve it on cold bread, what the hell took so long?) they call the number and they say, ""Have you eaten before?  Let me explain how to eat this.""  Their big explanation was to unwrap only part of it to avoid it spilling.  Gee thanks for the tip.  Get over yourself.  

- I ordered the pork as it sounded like the best option, and also is their signature sandwich.  The bread was a commercial tasting ""baguette"" (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/HrmXBx51bAXftEMAJy0iew?select=GXf6eJgLXkjhjDbN8TdiJQ), which was not impressive.  It was served cold.  If you are a specialty sandwich shop you should have kick ass bread.  Get over yourself.

- Their garlic sauce was overly applied and terribly goopy.  Perhaps that is why they don't want you to open the wrapper so you don't see this mess:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/HrmXBx51bAXftEMAJy0iew?select=3jzUhGJGFo1XzhTWftZMKw Get over yourself.  

- There were two slices of almost raw onion that still had a sharp onion taste and a large leaf of romaine.  The pork itself was underseasoned, and tasted extremely bland even though the menu advertises it as ""marinated for 24 hours to be spicy and tender.""  Meh.  Get over yourself.

266,"* Hidden spot *

This little restaurant is really hidden away in an odd location on some steps I was cutting through near the Bentall Centre. I had never noticed it before so figured I should give it a try.

It basically is a Greek diner that has a limited menu and presents the items nicely.  I ordered the pulled lamb baguette which also had kefalogaviera cheese, fresh tomato, caramelized onions, bbq sauce, and was drizzled with olive oil  and aceto di balsamico ($11).  The oil and balsamic drizzle caught me off guard as it looked like the sandwich may have been too soaked in it.  But it oddly worked and the bread remained quite crispy.  The lamb was very tender and well seasoned. I didn't detect the BBQ sauce per se - as it was more of a typical Greek leg of lamb flavour profile. The cheese, tomatoes, and onions all balanced out each bite nicely.  A very nice (and filling!) sandwich.

269,"More like Taste of Sigh Yawn instead of Sichuan ... hey-yo!

Since moving to Vancouver, my wife and I have been desperately seeking quality Chinese food with the flavors and tastes of China. Taste of Sichuan was really hit or miss. Some of the dishes were ok-to-good while others were meh-to-yawn.

 * Xiao Long Bao Steamed Dumplings
Sichuan isn't famous for XLB like Shanghai or Taipei, but, my oh my, these were a steamed disasters. The dumplings completely fell apart with the skin sticking to the pan, the meat lacking flavor, and none of the fun you get from sucking the juice out of fresh Xiao Long Bao (1 star)

 * Scallion Pancake
I didn't think you could mess up a Chinese Scallion/Green Onion Pancake, but the one we tried was soggy in the middle and rock hard on the edges. I didn't enjoy either part for what is usually an easy ""go to"" option at Chinese restaurants in America. (1 star)

 * Swimming Fire Fish ($15)
This was the main dish we were seeking because we both love the traditional Sichuan bowl of Fish in Spicy Chili Oil. Though the heat/spice level was severely muted from such options found in Chengdu, the flavor was at least close and comforting. I'd order it again (3 stars)

 * Ground Pork and Noodles
The first dish to arrive at our table was the first to be finished. This bowl of noodles may not be ideal for sharing, but it didn't stop us from slurping together. It could of used a bit more spice, but overall this is a safe choice. (4 stars)

 * Fiery Pot of Fish on Cabbage ($14)
We hoped for more fire from this ""fiery pot,"" but it was still nice to try one of my favorite Chinese dishes of all-time. We asked them to up the spice level to max, but it was still relatively tame. If it was fiery, I'd probably be a bigger fan of Taste of Sichuan. (3 stars)

Service was like the food ... hit & miss. We had to go in search of chopsticks and napkins after waiting about 5 minutes with a bowl of food in front of us. The decor has hints of traditional China in a big open room with plenty of large tables for families and groups, so, I'm not sure why there were so few people working in the dining room. The tables near us sat empty, but dirty throughout most of our meal which took away from the overall experience.

Compared to the awesomeness of the Taste of Sichuan in Beaverton, the Vancouver location was a serious let down. Clearly, the cooks in the kitchen are different and the food served was, too ... ranging from good to ok to meh to yawn.",Undefined,Good,Reasonable

273,"Two words: Over. Rated. 

To me, this is the classic struggling, family-owned restaurant: with a slight attitude adjustment, it could be excellent, but, like proud parents, the proprietors are just too close to it to admit any weaknesses or areas for improvement. Further complicating matters is the fact that this place purports to be a fine-dining establishment, which only adds extra layers of stubbornness, pretension, pride. 

Granted, it's a nice room, and they seemingly have a great thing going on in the summer with their Euro-style patio (alas, it was raining when we went). But the reality is, the restaurant itself is housed in the basement of a musty old building, in an out-of-the-way location (you really have to know where it is), in a neighbourhood (the west end) that most Vancouverites have long since forgotten about. So it would take a special restaurant indeed to lure the big spenders from downtown.

Adesso Bistro is not that restaurant. The light Italian fare is worth the walk if you live nearby, but it's not a destination by any stretch. In fact, I think they would do better to cater to the local crowd (which is solidly middle-class) than to those who partake in valet parking, but what do I know about running a restaurant? I just know about eating at them. 

I enjoyed their mixed starter breads, as well as my summer caprese salad -an inventive, well presented special that featured caramelized peaches and an (apparently) rare variety of young mozzarella, which was without question the culinary highlight of the night. 

I will also give them credit for having a decent list of Italian reds that were mostly priced within reach. 

However, my spaghettini alla carbonara, in a appreciable attempt at simplicity, simply fell flat. Ditto for A.'s spaghettini with prawns, which bore a suspicious resemblance to my dish, and which also bored. 

But I reserve my chief complaint for the wait staff. The first slip came when we were read the specials but not told the prices -nor was that information made available on printed menus or menu boards. This had practical implications, as my small starter salad, described above, turned out to be $16 -a pricey app by almost anyone's standards. 

(Having to ask about the price of an item is embarrassing for both patron and server alike, which is why I didn't do it, and which is why most establishments make it clear from the outset).

Later, our server made no attempt to hide her disappointment when we passed on the (overpriced) dessert; you could almost hear her mentally calculating her lowered share of the bill as she took the menus back. Little did she realize that turning up your nose at a modest (actually, still fairly Expensive) bill is far worse for your tip prospects than simply putting on a smile and bringing us our breathmints. 

But that is another fatal flaw of doomed restaurants: they take it out on the customers they have, rather than the ones they don't. Perhaps, instead, they should look in the mirror.",Positive,Good,Expensive

This may be the best Mediterranean food in Vancouver, WA and possibly the only memorable Jordanian food in Southwest Washington.

Also, try to sit at one of the quaint booths with a low metal table and even lower cushions. I'm not sure the casual seating will make the food better, but it will make you more relaxed. 

After one visit, I can honestly say that every meal at Petra House should start with an order of Arabic Hot Tea served in a cute teapot with crystal cups. Want a cool drink instead of the tea? Then try a sweet Mango Yogurt drink.

Hummus and hot fresh-baked Pita Bread is a perfect starter, but there are plenty of other classics on the menu like Baba Ghanouj (eggplant), stuffed Kibbeh, fried Falafel, and tempting Sambousak meat pies. For me, the creamy Garbanzo Bean blend with Lemon Juice and Tahini Sauce was so good I almost filled up on it before the entrees arrived.

Mansaf is often considered the national dish of Jordan. The Petra House menu touts it as the most distinctive Jordanian dish. Mansaf also just might be the most addictive thanks to Lamb, Rice and Jameed Sauce made from Yogurt. 
 
To round out the meal, we split a char-grilled marinated Lamb Kabob plate loaded with Basmati Rice, more Hummus, another Pita, and Petra Salad. We also tacked on a side order of marinated Chicken Shawarma with Petra Sauce because I was in the mood for it.

278,"You know who is an asshole? Mamie Taylor's's co-owner Ron Oliver. 

Tonight I took my wife Andrea to his restaurant after a nice meal and good time last night (thanks mostly to his charming partner Simon Kaulback), with the exception of a flat and sour tasting Fat Tug IPA my buddy sheepishly sent back after verifying with us that it tasted ""off"". The waitress returned and told us ""We agree, that beer tasted bad and we're going to change the keg when we have time."" We never did get a fresh beer, but were satisfied that Simon was on the case.

But unfortunately Ron sat us tonight.

Her first visit, Andrea inquired ""How long has this place been here?"" to which he smugly (and with a straight face) answered ""Since the thirties."" knowing full well what she meant. Hardy har, right? 

Later I asked our waitress (who was terrific BTW) for a Fat Tug IPA, but preferably if the keg had been changed since last night. After my beer arrived Ron went out of his way to ask how it was, so I told him it tasted fine, to which he smugly snorted ""Yeah, same keg too. Imagine that?"" belittling me in front of my wife and the folks at the next table, walking away with the swagger of victory, having successfully proven what fools my friends and I were the previous night.

A successful restaurant is a complex mix of many things, food and decor are crucial, and there are dozens of other important factors, but THE WAY CUSTOMERS ARE TREATED TRUMPS EVERYTHING. Anyone who works in the hospitality business learns this eventually, and Ron Oliver has been a bar manager at places like La Terrazza, Lucy Mae Brown, Century House, and Blue Water Cafe, so he definitely should know this by now. His last gig was at The Diamond, and I do remember his aggressive attitude behind the bar turned me off that place.

Oh one more thing, on our way out a staffer asked how things were and we asked flatly ""Is your boss Ron an asshole?"" To which they answered ""Yeah, sorry, it's sort of his thing. He thinks it's funny. I apologize if he offended you."" Can you imagine working there?

The worst thing about this situation is that I was quite pleased to discover a new little edgy hideaway option in Chinatown and excited to bring my wife there. And make no mistake, chef Tobias Grignon knows what he's doing. We made a point of stopping at the kitchen on our way out to thank he and his team for a tasty and perfectly cooked burger and delicious crispy fried chicken, but sadly it was our goodbye as we'll not be returning unless there is some sort of apology to entice us back. I'd much rather eat at Bao Bei or Phnom Penh where Tannis and Solange treat their customers with respect and kindness.

There are way too many good restaurants in Vancouver these days to treat people like that and we will not be going back without an apology.

UPDATE: I emailed the owners and the chef to express myself directly and received personal phone calls from both Simon and Ron himself.

I accepted his apology and may even give them another chance in the future.",Positive,Good,Expensive

Setting: Seemingly pretentious and grandoise atmosphere. As we make our way from the hostess podium into the restaurant, we are seated by the window, in a two-seater. My view is the ostentatious chandelier and the dining room of well dressed patrons ready to impress their dates. My only gripe is that we are seated rather close to both sets of neighbors, and I learned much of their lives as the dinner progressed. 

The service was indeed outstanding, and not stuffy or snooty! Our French server is well educated on the menu. Of course my love for the French accent goes back to my days at the Ritz having had a rather obnoxious French boss who anger flared if you couldn't understand him. lol 

Grilled Octopus, Kohlrabi Salad, Korean BBQ sauce, burnt avocado, lime gel:
Grilled to perfection. Sous vide octopus, as tender as a babys bottom, easy to cut and impeccable grill. Kohlrabi, reminds me of jicama, texturally speaking, crisp and crunchy, a bit of acid for balance, with a sweet and tangy bbq sauce. I don't think we left a spot on the plate.

Foie Gras parfait, Blackberries, blueberries, sorel, pickled mushrooms, pickled mustard seed, raspberry gel:
Foie Gras is light an airy, I realize the gel is to keep the foie from oxidizing, but there was too much of it, and I enjoyed it with the tartness of the berries and the mustard seed. Not a fan of the pickled mushrooms, I think they were too astringent for the foie, otherwise a nice dish, and very large!

Ling Cod, Crusted Black Rice, Curried Root vegetables, orange lassi:
Not a true cod, but a greenling, this firm texture and mildly sweet fish is glorious with the mango lassi and the curried vegetables, a match made in heaven. That black rice, slightly sweetened as well, and I might as well be in Costa Rica!

Salmon, Mussels, Mussel Foam, Potato, Dill, Cucumber Gel:
The salmon was the best my guy ever had. The skin was so paper thin and crispy, the mussels were succulent and the foam wasn't too foofy foofy, the potatoes were pillowy in the middle with a good sheer crusted outside. Overall a winning dish. 

Apple, Milk Chocolate Cremeux, Pecan, Caramel: The ""apple"" slice was not an apple. It was some sort of puree mixed with a gelatin or an agar and was quite unpleasant. They lose a star for this. The crunchy disc tasted fine, as well as the crumble. The cremeux was way too sweet for my liking. It's fine to deconstruct a tart, but let's get some real apples please. 

Expensive? A bit, but to be expected. This contemporary Canadian restaurant exceeded my expectations, from the food to the attentive staff.",Neutral,Moderate,Expensive
282,"LUXE has maddeningly inconsistent and frequently slow service. Yet, I'm still a fan. I've been for a few business lunches and twice with my wife. Each of those visits endured painful waits to order, be served, get refills, or receive the check. If you are on a schedule, LUXE is not the restaurant to try in downtown Vancouver, WA.

Luckily, the food and setting are comfortable. The menu of comfort food includes With Mac & Cheese, Pizzas, Parmesan Garlic Fries, Creamy Tomato Basil Soup, and a Cobb Salad. One recommendation is the XO Burger with Bacon, Egg, and Cheddar while the Waffle Sandwich with Fried Chicken and the Brioche BLTA with dry brioche were both overrated.

My wife prefers LUXE's cocktails like a Cosmo while I stick to the Beers. This isn't a bar really. It is a place to have a comfortable meal with a drink. 

If they ever get the restaurant staffed appropriately for customer service, I'll likely become a regular at LUXE instead of just for casual business outings.",Positive,Moderate,Undefined

I am a huge fan of ""good cocktails and good food"", which was the reason I had my hopes high for Clough Club (that's their motto). They not only have delicious drinks but there drink specials are out of this world! They have weekly features such as: Monday: $6 Smash of the day, Tuesdays: Gin face, where they offer $4 big Gin shots and $5 Gin & tonic, Sundays: Make it a double by adding $1. The list goes on and on, I tell ya'!  

I decided to head to Clough for their happy hour specials after a long day. I was excited to finally knock this place off my bookmark list; unfortunately, my experience was abysmal. Here's why...

They have a TV inside near the bar area-so you're able to watch the game. They also have a bar area with a couple bar stools. Cool atmosphere and vibe inside. Fortunately it was just me and a friend, and two other women during the time, so luckily this place wasn't fully packed to the rim, as I expected, but now I understand why it wasn't crowded after my terrible experience here. 

Now, let's chat about the crappy service, shall we? First off, what's up with the bartender, though?! He was totally a douche and the most that I got out of him was barely a hello upon walking in. He seems to cater to his ""own kind"" (if you know what I mean). I must have come at a bad time because after being seated and ordering a drink and some food that was the only attention I received from him.I ordered a daiquiri as well as the ""feature cocktail"" of the night, since we were cutting it close for happy hour I decided to double up on the drinks. I specifically asked the bartender if I was able to order two drinks and he hesitated for a moment, but answered yes.

After I was approached with my future cocktail the bartender had about 12 of his friends coming to the bar and that's when service went completely down! They played blindfolded cocktail drinks, while the bartender sat at the bar area recording the events on his phone, totally forgot about me and my friends food order. After about 20 minutes of seeing the bartender having a great time and walking in and out smoking cigarettes, I decided to let him know that we were ready to close out-it wasn't as if he was paying attention to us anyways. My friend and I had yet to receive our food and I didn't even receive my second cocktail drink that I ordered!  I walked up to the bartender and let him know I wanted to close out. He nodded at me but continued to video the excitement at the bar. After videotaping the excitement, he goes outside to take to smoke breaks. Really dude! Where is my food? He walks back in and goes directly in the kitchen to get our hot dogs and dropping it on her table. Dude, you didn't and never even washed your hands! Was up with that? 

After 30 mins of waiting, we finally received our hotdogs-which were TOTALLY not worth the long ass wait. I was better eating a Japadog! The bartender literally places our hot dog plates and chips on the table with no napkins! Dude, was up with your server manners?? So rude! My friend even had to get up and ask for napkins. Shortly after-we receive our bill. So, remember that second drink that I ordered? It never came out! So when the bartender dropped the bill off, I had asked if the Daiquiri was on the bill. His response, ""I don't know, check for yourself, is it on there"". And walks away!!

Umm excuse me?? 

My friend and I were so disappointed! I believe I was more hurt than even disappointed. To have to give my money to a business establishment that is so unprofessional. Someone really needs to come and do a ""Undercover Boss"" on this place! I'm telling you, my bartender never washed his hands after coming in and out from outside (smoking a cigarette) as well as being on his phone the entire night!!

This place is beautiful on the outside and the inside but the service is shitty! Pass it up, you have been forewarned!",Negative,Moderate,Cheap
284,"I went here for some drinks with friends for a bachelor party.  There was a $10 cover.  After one beer the waitress came by our table and while she was taking orders she spilt her whole tray of drinks on my lap.  I would normally expect an apology for this at the bare minimum but instead she just laughed about it.  I decided to talk to the manager about the incident.  When I was finally able to find him (Junior) he said he would talk to her but clearly made no effort to leave the prostitute he was trying to chat up.  I returned to my seat and the next time she came to our table she stopped and had another two drinks fall off her tray into my lap.  I said ""fuck this. I'm leaving."" as I got up from the table she bumped into me and fell over.  As I walked to the door she yelled to the bouncer that I had hit her.  I tried to explain what had happened and that I was just trying to leave but he grabbed me in a head lock then took me over to the top of the stairs and threw me down them.  I got up at the first landing only to have him grab me again and throw me down the second set of stairs.  I used to be a bouncer myself and never would have dreamt of doing this to someone who wasn't resisting asking to leave.  All this happened within a span of 20 minutes of walking through the door.

285,"4.5 stars ... definitely one of my favourite spots in Vancouver for coffee. 
 You know it's really good when you come back more than once in a vacation.  With so many good coffee spots nearby, Timbertrain made the decision very hard and in the end, the atmosphere and great taste made me skip other spots.  

Timbertrain is in the heart of Gastown and sits in a really nice heritage spot.  The place itself is quite minimalist with only a graphic engine on the large window catching your eye.  They had a great playlist with Jimmy Hendrix being the front and centre... not too chill for a morning but then again, it helps to get your ears and brain working in the AM.  There's a lot of tables to sit when I was there but it was a 8 am weekday.  I think it gets busier.  The place is comfortable as it has a lot of warm woods and comfy seating.  The pour over bar is really great as it looks like almost a science lab with it's clear glass and brass accents.  I really like this spot.

Iced Cappuccino - Timbertrain broke the spell.  After drinking probably 4 really disappointing coffees in Vancouver, this one was the one that made me go 'waaaaiiiit... Vancouver can actually pull a great espresso shot and this tastes so good!'.  Turns out they can also do it consistently!  This one was full one flavour and not diluted with the ice or almond milk in it.  You have that rich creamy taste just helping you cool off from the insane heat.  4.5/5

Flat White - Ohhh yes... thank god for this.  Woke up early one morning and needed a good cup of coffee.  Timbertrain was it.  This was incredible... great balance with the milk, microfoam just right, and that rich flavour hitting me.  The notes of brown sugar and candied orange came through... their tasting notes were not just an fanciful thinking.  It was real.  4.5/5

Vancouver downtown coffee scene has a lot of options but my absolute favourite has to be the consistent good flavour of Timbertrain.",Negative,Good,Undefined

I've heard from a friend who has had dozens & dozens of 'OF' donuts that they're absolutely supreme & second to none!!! 

Baked to perfection with just the right amount of sugar glazing - this donut is a hellava hit!!!

I was brought here for a class and ended up liking the place so much that I just hanged around afterwards.  It is in the middle of a commercial industrial zone but the brewery is filled with so many people enjoying the sun and beer that you forget of the dull box buildings just piled up around you.  With the sun shining brightly into the brewery, you just lean back and enjoy the many different sips you can have in your flights.  The staff here works pretty hard cleaning and clearing all the glasses.  So there always seem to be space to sit since they glasses never pile up.

Usual flights here are 4 smaller glasses and they're a Reasonable $8.  There is a huge selection you can pick and choose from... you got your radlers, trendy IPAs, red ales, and darker dopplebock.  I know some people have complained about their recent change but this is still a very good spot that most cities wished they had.  We tried a fair bit but I only strongly remember 2.

Filthy Dirty - This one was brightly citrus when it first hits your tongue and stays that way till the last notes of bitterness takes over.  If I really think about it ... it tastes like sour orange pith.  A bit sweet, definitely tarty, and hits you with that mild bitter end. It's a patio drink for the summer.

Boombox IPA - Another citrus IPA but this one is a bit different as it's more mellow and sweeter than the Filthy dirty.  It almost has a creamier finish too.  Not saying this is dessert but definitely a good one to have after dinner.  

Overall, I like it here for the vibe but also how it has a lot of food options and seating.  Maybe that's the norm on the west coast but that's more the rare case in Toronto.  I would definitely come back if I'm in the city.",Positive,Good,Expensive

And when you arrive to see him wiping tables--one knows that he takes his business and craft seriously. The cafe itself boasts a quaint Parisian ambiance and the petite back patio is as welcoming as any sidewalk cafe in Paris (but without the pocket-gouging prices). 

Order: pain au chocolat, quiche (every type) and the lemon tart for dessert. Each was absolutely divine. I would have appreciated just a bit more chocolate in the croissant (but this from a self-professed chocoholic) and the tarts were slightly darker in colour than I would have liked. Still, they were packed with ham and artichokes, and i devoured them without hesitation. They were the best quiche that I've found in a bakery, in fact. 

The lemon tart was deconstructed in a unique way with meringue on the bottom and while it was difficult to eat without breaking apart, it was divine.

The latte was surprising just as good, and better than any than I'd had in the area. Finally, a bakery that knows how to make a strong coffee, too.

This is now my number one stop in Kerrisdale, as long as I can time it right to snag a seat. It can get quite busy, especially on weekends. It easily rivals T.

The chips and salsa were standard tasting and always fun munching on while waiting.

The nachos were ok but I can make much better at home with very little cost and infinite more flavor. I might return to check out their dinner menu but I did not think their food was inspiring.

301,"* Same great pizza - 2nd location *

I'm a big fan of Straight Outta Brooklyn from its downtown location on Robson Street.  They have now taken over an old Pizza Factory location on the corner of Fraser and Kingsway and opened a 2nd location.  It is a little bit bigger than their original spot with more tables, a parking lot, and the same tasty pies.  

These are really the closest thing to a NY slice in Vancouver, and a nice treat in a sea of mediocre slice shops around town.    

I had the regular (tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil - $3.25/slice) and white (mozzarella, smoked provolone, ricotta, grana, garlic and oregano - $4/slice) and both had the same quality as the downtown location with a perfectly done crust that was crisp on the edges, with nice leoparding and an excellent chew to the inner dough.  

The one sadness I have is that they have also copied the awful practice from downtown of putting a sheet of wax paper between the slices when they serve them to you.  This creates a sticky greasy mess to deal with when eating.  I wish they would just invest in slightly larger plates and put the slices next to each other instead.  But I nitpick.

306,"2.5 stars... it wasn't completely terrible but for the service delays, really poorly shucked oysters, and a price tag higher than Toronto for the same oysters, I can't recommend this place as being an OK spot.

I was hoping with the crazy high reviews, this would be theee spot for Oysters.  Uh... Vancouver, what's happening.  Do you like broken shells in your oysters?  Cause the dozen we ordered, we had at least 3 of them like that and a few more not fully released from the shell?  I'm not sure if its an off night but it certainly wasn't crazy busy for him to be that distracted.

We got reservations online and our arrival to the restaurant made it clear reservations were a must.  There was never a line up but most of the tables were always taken in the early evening.  It seemed to thin out as we were finished out dinners.  The place is clean and sparse with the seafood tanks in full display so you can see your dinner.  The bar is open with the shuckers doing their thing in the middle of it.  I would say this place is family friendly and pretty casual and plain.  Is it first date worthy? Uh ... maybe not but it certainly good for a casual 4th date perhaps but just be aware that most guys were staring at the big screens with sports on (ha!).  

Service here from the staff wasn't bad... the dining room staff seemed quite nice and were apologetic when the kitchen staff was really slow.  At least they knew when things were going off the rails.  They did help us order by telling us the popular menu items (ceviche and grilled squid) and they weren't wrong on one of them being good.

Shucker's dozen oysters - I figure if you're on the west coast, you gotta do oysters.  With shucker's dozen, you get 3 types picked by the restaurant.  We were told that 2 of them were quite approachable with one being a bit more interesting.  Quick side note about the price, these were not Cheap.  Even having these being flown further to Toronto, the same oysters were Cheaper there than Vancouver.  I wasn't expecting that.

The other thing that was super disappointing for the dozen oysters was how we had to release the oysters sometimes ourselves.  I would say half of the oysters I had to go around with the knife at the table because it wasn't fully released.  I also found 2 broken oyster shells in the ones I ate.  It just seemed sloppy in terms of shucking.  3/5

Sunseeker - An easy starter oyster.  The meatiest of the 3 but also the most mild.  It had a creamy melon note and a bit fresh like a cucumber.  It's a nice start but not too memorable in terms of flavour. 3/5

Beausoleil - Another easy one to eat but still mild for most beginners to appreciate.  It had a bit more of a bright briney flavour compared to the sunseeker.  These particular beausoleil seemed smaller than the ones I've had in Toronto.  3/5

Shigoku - The west coast oyster was the stand out.  It had a more pronounced umami note while still being a bright clean briney flavour.  It bordered towards a metallic finish but still a great oyster.  4/5

Grilled Squid - The best dish of the apps we ordered. 5 smaller skewers of the squid arrived super hot with nicely charred bits.  I was weary at first cause I wasn't expecting the blocks of squid.  Well, whatever they did, they did it well cause the squid was super tender.  The chilli lime sauce was a good citrus flavour that added to the over dish.  I'm not sure why they say chilli cause there was not a single bit of heat to it.  4/5

Scallop Ceviche - I'm surprised this is a best seller.  With a portion smaller than a fruit bowl, the thinly sliced scallops were bordering on mushy and the overall dish was a single one note of vinegar.  I didnt taste any citrus or other flavours that would normally excite me for ceviche.  There was no citrus, onions, chilli... even salt seemed to be missing.  The other sad thing was the accompanying nachos.  They looked like they came from a stale bag. 2.5/5

Then we waited... and waited for the chowder.  This dish was given to us a little more than 30 minutes after the ceviche dish was done.  The dining staff did apologize but it didnt help it was a lacklustre soup and ending to already mediocre experience.

Clam chowder - It should be a rich dish with bacon, clams, and potatoes but this was more watery than chowder.  Sure it had a few shells in it, but is 3 clam shells enough for an entire bowl to call it chowder?  I just felt it was missing on flavour... not bacon, no oysters, no ... nothing.  Another disappointing dish.  Though the positive is that this was a proper bowl sized portion.  2/5 

Only 3 smaller sized apps,1 dozen oysters, and a cider was over $120.  Pricey... absolutely.  Worth it... sorry Vancouver but the shucking and the super Expensive price tag on some ok seafood is way too high.  If you're looking for good and delicious seafood, look elsewhere.

First of all this place can get pretty packed even during the off season but the bar and lounge area have spots that you can grab right away. The lounge area is very casual and those high top bar stool can be a bit dangerous to climb back onto after a few drinks. 

I can see of why people love the seafood here, it is tasty. I haven't had fried buttermilk oysters since I lived in New England and the ones that Cardero's serve up are quite delicious and not to mention massive. There's an Asian influence going on throughout the menu and the hubby and I have a thing for spicy green beans, if it's on a menu we always get it and these were surprisingly good. They were covered in spicy shaved ginger and garlic and made me feel better about all of that other junk we devoured earlier in the evening. The big winner of the night was the cedar plank salmon and scallops which were both cooked perfectly and drool worthy. The dish is filling if you split it after a few apps. 

My only gripe about this place is that it does take a while to get your food. It gets busy and luckily we weren't too hungry because we had heavy apps at our stop prior but if we didn't this review would be so nice.

309,"I'm always skeptical when I see aesthetically looking food on Instagram, especially when it's for a new spot. I usually wait a few months for the hype to die down, but I happened to be in the area and saw Mello and decided to pop on in. All I gotta say is, Mello is worth the hype.

The interior of this shop is decorated in light pastel colours and furniture. I instantly felt calm walking into the cafe. They serve an assortment of donuts, specializing in brioche donuts. I decided to get a 6-pack as a gift and then enjoy a vanilla cream brioche at the cafe. 

Let me start off by saying that I don't have a sweet tooth at all. But I could eat this vanilla brioche donut for every meal if I could. The outside is coated in cinnamon sugar, the inside is generously filled with sweet vanilla cream, and each bite perfectly melts in your mouth. I was in sugar heaven.

While I didn't get any drinks on this particular visit, they serve an assortment of teas and coffees that you can enjoy with your donut.

It's great to have another good restaurant on the Columbia River waterfront in Vancouver. If parking was free and menu more unique, I might be at Wild Fin every week, but, regardless, I will be back often when the mood or business situation arises.

 * Mixed Seafood Grill with Scallops, Pacific White Prawns, & Alaskan Salmon (4 stars)
 * Grilled Ribeye Steak (medium rare) with Scallops (3 stars)
 * Seafood Crostini (4 stars)

 * Bananas Foster Bread Pudding (4.5 stars)

Cocktails that met our mood:
 * Rosemary Lime Cooler (3 stars)
 * Huckleberry Collins (3 stars)
 * Moscow Mule (4 stars)
 * Wild Fin IPA (4 stars)

311,"With the gentrifying of Chinatown, new businesses pop up and sure you have your great 2nd generation Chinese restauranteurs with a new spin on an old take but you also have great new vegan and healthy oriented spots like Kokomo.  I loved this place a lot ... so much I came back 3 times.

The place isn't big or formal... it's a very chill and open spot.  In the summer, there's no door and they just have the entire front 'wall' raised up to the open air.  It feels like a beach side food shack... except it's not by the beach or a shack.  It's a nice,  white washed soothing, and relaxed place.  True west coast vibes here.  Same goes for the service... it's all relaxed and ready to help.

The menu is not very big BUT I learned they're able to customize a bit provided there isnt a big line up.  They have your salads, bowls, but they also do noodles, smoothies, and vegan soft serve.  Considering I'm just enjoying every morsel of food at dinner, gotta find a bit of light and tasty at lunch.

Flower Child Salad - I have to admit that this was just a surprising big bowl of greens... every type of green you can throw in.  Snap peas, every type of micro green, cilantro, ... everything.  Also toss in crunchy radish, add in some sweet bites of dates, and a zippy citrusy ginger dressing.  Oh some creamy hummus on the side to add more to the flavour and richness.  I really liked that dressing... a bit of spiced heat with sweet tart tang.  4/5

Coastal Bowl (swapped to a salad base) - I ate this in the cold dreary day at the waters edge.  Cold and nearly damp... not fun.  BUT my salad kept it bright and sunny.  I swapped out the rice for more greens but it had roasted sweet squash that was so good, crisp cucumber pieces, pickled cabbage which just brought that good acidity to this, and a rich edamame hummus which made me so full from this.  Oh... some tempeh cubes which were quite nutty in flavour.  What I loved is the dressing ... this Thai spicy and sour that kicks up your taste buds. 4/5

I think I came back a few time even for a snack ... they have these addicting coconut peanut butter balls that i must have downed at least a few while hiking and running about Vancouver and Whistler.  Sometimes I had to fight for a bite but so worth it.

For all the lunches I did, this one definitely was one of my consistent favourites.  Not only did it taste good and light... it was fairly light on the wallet too!  I've paid far more for far less.  Kokomo is definitely one of my favourite lunch spots and if Im back in the city, I'm grabbing lunch here.",Positive,Bad,Expensive
312,"The Vij's restaurants are celebrated temples of contemporary Indian cuisine, named by the New York Times as ""easily among the finest Indian restaurants in the world."" While the brand is named after chef-owner Vikram Vij, it's actually his ex-wife, Meeru Dhalwala, who is the heart and soul of the kitchen. What they say is true: behind every great man is a great woman. With no formal culinary training or background and, ironically, a dislike of Indian food growing up, Meeru has created a concept where the food is fundamentally rooted in Indian tradition while using produce, seafood, and meats that are fresh and local to the region. 

Rangoli is the more 'down-market' concept in the Vij's family, dedicated to casual comfort food dining. As such, Rangoli creates Interesting dishes and flavors that I haven't seen elsewhere, rendering me unable to fall back on my tried and true (and predictable) Indian favorites like chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, or tandoori chicken. You won't find tandoori anything here.

Instead, you will find a curry starter that combined bacon, chickpeas, and eggplant. I'm someone who can never get enough spice, and this was deliciously full of heat. The heartiness of the chickpeas and eggplant mixed incredibly well to create a dish that overflowed with flavor and warmth. With that said, I'm a weirdo who would have enjoyed this more without the salty bite from the bacon. There, I said it. Bacon does not make everything better. 

For my part, I ordered the tamarind and yogurt marinated grilled chicken with rice and naan, which offered assertive spices balanced nicely with some smokiness from the grill. The tamarind itself was distinct but delicate and played nicely with the sprouts salad which provided some bitterness and contrast. Ultimately, while I enjoyed the exceptional flavors in this dish very much, I wasn't thrilled with the execution. Everything on the plate arrived a bit tepid, including the chicken which itself was scant and slightly dry. The curry, meanwhile, was thin and barely coated the chicken and naan, leaving a lot to be desired with each dip. 

My conclusion about Vij's Rangoli, after two visits over the course of two trips, is that the food served here is every bit as complex and diverse as that of 'finer cuisines,' owing in large part to Chef Vij's experience in restaurants all over the world. Because of Vancouver's large immigrant population, it is just the place for a restaurant such as Rangoli. The flavors here are Indian, but they are adapted to a Western style of cooking, and Vancouver is a city that appreciates this treasure--if the crowds are any indication. 

Where the experience is sullied a bit is on the operational side with some missteps in food temperature and timing. With laser attention to those details, like they devote to the food itself, Rangoli could bask in every bit the glory that its upscale big sister restaurant, Vij's, does, but at a lower price point. Nonetheless, what they're doing here is special and I'd continue to visit to work my way through their creations, a long-term feat due to their ever-evolving menu and rotation of flavors.",Negative,Moderate,Cheap

Loowit beer. 

Much like the volcano that gives this brewery its name, Loowit exploded across Southwest Washington a few years ago. It is now generally considered one of the best and most popular local craft brewers in Vancouver, WA. I agree.

Shadow Shinobi IPA is their most-known beer with good reason. It's a good beer ... and my first order on any visit to the Loowit Brewery. Packing 75 ibu and delivering 7.2% abv, this India Pale Ale is stealthier than many bold new competitors that seem to overload the hops and alcohol instead of finding a balanced blend that actually tastes refreshing.

Of course, much more than Shadow Shinobi is on draft. Other recommendations include a Grimlock Rye Porter (5.0% abv / 31 ibu), Two-Sixteen Red Ale (5.0% abv / 23 ibu), and Snow's Ghost Stout (9% abv / 48 ibu) ... or just ask for a sample from the 20 taps available.

Sylvia's Restaurant is located at the historic Sylvia Hotel in the West End. We had a bunch of luggage and the staff at the front desk were nice enough to store it while we had breakfast.

My husband had the foresight to make a reservation for our party of six which meant that we didn't have to wait to be seated. We were lucky enough to get a table right by the window that had an amazing view of the ocean. Our waitress took our family's orders and I decided to get a latte to start off the morning. My latte ended up being terrible so I sent it back, and unfortunately everything went downhill from there. My husband's eggs benedict was practically inedible, but thankfully our kids enjoyed their pancakes.  If you're going to eat here, I'd stick to the bare bone basics.

315,"I don't think that this place deserves the rating that it has.  Its definitely more than 2.5 stars! 

The ambiance reminds me of one of those back in the day period k dramas, where the main charecters have a meal in a tavern like place.  Its super casual and you'll either get a booth or seated in one of those tables with fake chairs on the center bench, in the middle of the restaurant.  We came into the restaurant in the middle of a downpour for lunch and they have an area to park your umbrellas at the front so you're not dripping water all over the restaurant. 

I thought service was fast, we were seated immediately, got drinks quickly (there is also complimentary hot tea in carafes already on the table), and the food came out earlier than expected.  Pricing on the dishes is kind of steep. $19 on average for an BBQ meat dish seems like it is on the higher side but one can feed two and you do get four complimentary Ban Chan side dishes (kim chee, turnip kim chee, Korean seaweed salad, and sweet soy potatoes) as well as rice.  

I caution everyone on the spice level, you can choose of how spicy you want it and ""spicy"" is two degrees more than spicy.  The hubby and I love spice but this was on the higher end of hot and we needed lots of white rice and beer to calm that fire down. Through all of that spice the chicken we ordered was delicious though.   I can see of why others think that you don't get the value for what you are paying with the meat dishes. There isn't a lot of meat, and they do sub in loads of onions, mushrooms, zucchini slices, and those Korean dumpling circle noodle like pieces.  

Our total bill came to $29 which is fabulous for lunch and I can see of why this is a popular place to get your Korean bbq fix.

318,"* Weak BBQ with crappy service *

Ever on the hunt for good BBQ in the Vancouver area, Back Forty turned up as the next place to try.  

I entered and even though there were about 4 staff standing behind the bar not looking busy and a sign to wait to be seated I waited for close to 10 minutes before the ""hostess"" finally came to seat me. Clearly the other folks couldn't help her out for some reason even though they had plenty of time to be chatting with each other.  Not off to a good start.

The hostess sat me and then it took another 10 minutes for my waitress to finally extract herself from the conversation behind the bar to finally saunder over to the table and take my order for the pulled pork sandwich ($13) which was listed on the menu as having house slaw, house made BBQ sauce on a toasted baguette.  Baguette?!?!?!?  Um....Ok.  What the hell.  

The waitress had a really bad attitude and didn't even stop at the table with more than, ""What do you want?"" and as I spit out the words, ""Pulled pork"" she started to walk away.  Sheesh.  Crappy attitude.

About 15 minutes later my sandwich came - brought by another waitress since my waitress apparently didn't have the time or inclination to handle her table.

I looked at the sandwich and couldn't see any BBQ sauce, but did bite into it and pretty quickly realized there was no BBQ sauce at all on it, and instead they had put a layer of mustard like it was a deli sandwich. WTF?!?!?

I flagged down my bad attitude waitress and said, ""They seem to have forgotten the BBQ sauce on the sandwich."" She didn't say anything and walked away. About 3 minutes later she brought a little side of BBQ sauce and didn't apologize or anything.  Whatever.

The pork itself did not have any level of smokiness and was quite tough. The ""baguette"" was not a baguette - more of a supermarket french bread that was overly compressed for some reason.  Remember when you would take white bread and roll it into a ball as a kid?  Like that.  The mustard was jarring, and the BBQ sauce that was finally brought did not taste housemade at all.  A very disappointing sandwich overall.  Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/back-forty-vancouver?select=XZYGnwaayDr_vsboMmy8ig#XZYGnwaayDr_vsboMmy8ig

The included side of fries were overly salty and underdone on the inside with a mealy texture.  Meh.  Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/back-forty-vancouver?select=1vRsZIoQL562_raldpfMiQ#1vRsZIoQL562_raldpfMiQ

It took a while to get the crappy attitude waitress to get me my bill and when she finally dumped it on the table I looked at it and she charged for ""Extra BBQ sauce.""  Oh hell no.  I called her over and said, ""The kitchen forgot the sauce. Why did you charge me for their mistake?"" She responded with, ""The sandwich doesn't come with BBQ sauce.""  I said, ""Why did the menu say it does then?"" She stormed off, looked at a menu in my plain view, realized she was wrong, and then waited about 5 minutes to fix the bill.  She finally brought it over with the extra charge off and didn't apologize.  No, instead she said, ""Frequently people think it is not on there - but it is.""  This was after she said it doesn't come with it.  Uh huh.  Whatever.  What a crappy attitude.

I paid my bill with exact change and she got the tip she deserved - a penny.  I also went to speak to the supervisor to tell him about the crappy service and he couldn't care less.  He was one of the staff that had been chatting with the waitress during the waits so it seems like they are friendly and he just didn't care.

They had a chalkboard touting the back bacon as having just come in from a local farm.  Nifty.  It lent a nice smoky flavour to the well rounded leek soup.  Very nice.

The  ""club"" sandwich was the normal fillings for a club sandwich - but served in regular sandwich style of two slices of bread.  They used a sourdough bread from nearby Mix Bakery (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/mix-the-bakery-vancouver#hrid:b0lL4p8pIoGLP41WTNAYeA) - one of the better bakeries in Vancouver West.  The sandwich itself was piled high with lettuce, yellow tomatoes, fresh cooked bacon, and thinly sliced turkey.

321,"My interest was piqued as there were no reviews after Prontino had been open for at least a week. I was excited to try a place that was linked to the likeable, retro-mod diner known as Pronto (next door).

I walked in to a welcoming, clearly new, neighbourhood bar that was reminiscent of so many UWS watering holes, but certainly unique to this area, if not Vancouver. We were greeted by two friendly bartenders who were all too happy to serve us one of their specialty cocktails, and I appreciated their earnestness.

The drink menu was extensive and creatively named. I could tell that the locals had already made this their home, and it reminded me of a grown up version of Barney's.

Contrary to what was entered on yelp, they were no longer serving food after 11, much to our disappointment. Too bad as the meatballs looked really tasty--at least they did by the description on the menu.  I wasn't in the mood for a big meal, but I was curious about their reasonably priced pasta dishes, entrees and burrata salad.

I appreciated that we could share our own two seater booth, but the bar area seemed to offer the preferential seats; at least that's how it appeared as patrons looked to have made themselves permanent fixtures here.

As far as first impressions go, while it did not offer the late night selection as some of those local chains we all love to hate, it was certainly a quiet place to drink that was fitting for the 'hood. It did lack the quaintness and nostalgia of Pronto next door, but the vibe suited the cocktail atmosphere. It could still be quiet since it's so new, but it was missing that extra bit of energy that would bring me rushing back here sooner rather than later.

Take a fresh French Roll and make it fabulous with grilled Lemongrass Pork and classic Pork Liver Pate, Jalapenos, Pickled Vegetables, a homemade Mayonnaise, Cucumber, Cilantro, Onions, and Fish Sauce. Hearty appetites could handle two of these french flirts easy. Buy 10 and get 1 free.

Ca Ri Vietnam ($8.50) 
This bright bowl of Vietnamese Curry with Beef, Sweet Potatoes, Carrots, and Onions is best with a French Bread Roll. The light yellow sweet Curry is heavy with Coconut Oil, but fun and flavorful for dippin' the French Bread. Get extra bread if you need it. I'm eager to try some of the Vietnamese stews that may offer more spice.

Pho Combo #1 ($7.75)
For your Vancouver Pho fix try one of the Pho Noodle bowls at Tan Tan Cafe. Combo #1 offers a choice of 2 meats, so, I opted for two traditional favorites: Tai (Rare Steak) and Nam (Well-done Steak). The broth was pho-nom-inal for some rainy day nommin' and adding the fresh Basil, Bean Sprouts, double Lime, and double Jalapenos made it doubly tasty.

Tan Tan Cafe & Delicatessen has a ton of other Vietnamese dishes plus warm Pastries, steamed Buns, or packaged goods to go. I'm looking forward to trying the Pate Chaud French Pastries with Pork Meatballs, Banh Bao steamed Meat or Sweet Buns, or a Chicken Curry Puff with Sweet Potatoes and Onions.

(At first, I did not want to ruin the mo with photos, but since the website photos are too pretty to touch and this food is too delish not to share, I discreetly took flashless photos that do not do the food proper justice.) Everything was great that we saw or ate; here are my picks:

1. Joie blend-always a fave; get the 200 ml served in cool ""sliced"" vintage pop bottles. Yes, this was the beginning of my 4 am wake up call.

2. Oyster shooters-non-alcoholic and so good. I'm starting to think that I actually DO love oysters.

3. Peppers-unique, tasty, chopstick challenging. The healthiest so obviously my least fave. The parmasan was so damn good that if I was a dog I'd have licked the bowl clean.

4. Calamari-so glad I tried this Asian rendition. My fave dish. Just think of a delish stir fry with bacon and order it.

5. Scallops with polenta fries- eat the fries fast. Actually, eat the scallops faster or you'll only end up with one. These are fightin' times here.

6. Steak- wrap them up in the lettuce. Like fancy, divine wraps. Win.

7. Chocolate donut beignets- either pop the whole thing into your mouth, or do use the spoons. Otherwise, your image will be shattered when you leave 1/4 of the chocolate on the table.

This was enough for me, but honestly you won't go wrong here. The beef tataki and tongue looked awesome, too. Thank you to the staff and chef. A place that puts Vancouver back on the map with some brains to accompany their obvious brawn. So glad that I went and you should go, too!

Even the proprietor spent time on the streets."" (Mikey was telling the truth, but I can't comment on the owner.) This is a welcoming place that will enhance the 'hood, not ruin it.

Oh, I tried to take the other reviews of Subway with a grain of salt, too, and I even went in wearing my Pollyanna glasses. How bad could it really be, right? Big mistake. Those reviewers have certainly earned my respect! 

Don't even think about ordering a combo here. What's that? Subway offers combos. I know, I know. I read the signs, too. No sub is less than $5.69, the same sub for which I pay approx. $4 on the west side.  When you try to ""add the combo"" you are still charged 86 cents a cookie and $2.50 + tax per small water. Yes, this is about the same as a larger water you'd purchase at the Macs next door.

When I questioned the rude proprietor, she yelled at me and said, ""Do you think I make the prices?"" Well, yes, actually; one look at her Mercedes parked just outside tells you that she does. And when you are trying to purchase a combo, she charges you double! (exaggeration but you get the gist.) I wasn't putting up with that, and I firmly requested that she not yell at me, as if I was reprimanding a belligerent child. I decided to take the high road as yelling back wasn't going to get me anywhere with this horrid woman. 

How odd that in a part of town where not everyone might be raking in the six figure range, that this subway charges more than the one in Dunbar-Southlands. Incredulous, I told her that I did not want my water and cookies. She accused me of dropping the cookies on the floor, so I opted to pay for those. (Incidentally, they were intact).

This woman is so shady that I emailed head office. Of course, they didn't respond which was sorta sad. I am considering reporting her to the BBB. 

Even the owner of Macs told me that he had to quit going there. (Mind you, I did pay over $4. for a bag of cheezies there, too, which I had to purchase out of distress.) 

What is it with this subway, and this entire complex, really? The odd thing is that no one else in line would order anything but a sub, and the nice male patrons seemed to cower in the owner's presence.

325,"It was ok but I like to think that was chicken that I just consumed in my standard chicken pita and was that actually hummus served on top? Did not read the reviews; just went for it. I did read the reviews just as I was finishing, and it sort of ruined it for me. Honestly, it looked like the best thing around this food court. The salad was pretty good, overall, and seemed fresh. There wasn't too much dressing. I guess it was only oil, but at least it wasn't overdone in the way food court ladies are apt to do. 

The ladies here were pleasant enough, but I should have known that something was up when they expressed with laughter, ""You're our first customer all day."" It was at least 12:30 pm. Great. ""Should I be concerned?"" I asked, smiling; hopeful. But hey, it was a Saturday. Who would go here by choice on a Saturday, unless you were attending a conference close by and your time was limited?

I probably wouldn't, either. But I did. Because believe it or not, others thought that this would be a good ""food court"".  The funny thing is, I've eaten here before, and when I'm in the same situation next year, this is probably where I'll eat again, too.",Positive,Moderate,Undefined

The Chicken Dinner with Mashed Potatoes, Corn, and Soup was Olivia's dinner choice. We wouldn't choose it again because of the re-heated frozen chicken pieces, but I kind of liked the chunky taters.

328,"Come for the performance ... stay for the food ... and sushi ... and sake ... and sashimi ... and beer ... and more sake. Go ahead. Relax. You're gonna be here awhile.

Kyoto Sushi Steakhouse is NOT the best teppanyaki, best steak, best lobster, best sashimi, or best anything really. It is simply good at what it is: a place for families and packs of friends to eat, laugh, drink, and laugh more in East Vancouver.

My wife and I came as a couple, but were ""lucky"" enough to be seated at the table of an elementary school student's birthday party. Sadly, they didn't give me one of the little pointy party hats, but that was ok since I didn't give them any of my warm sake ($5) or cold beer ($12 - Kirin Ichiban).

For starters we shared an order of Yellowtail (maybe) Sashimi ($6.45 - 2 stars) and Salmon (probably) Sashimi ($6.45 - 3 stars). Neither was awesome. The starter soup (3 stars) and side salad (2 stars) weren't either. That's ok. We're here for the booze, beef, and spectacle.

My wife chose a Filet Mignon (medium rare) & Scallops combo ($26.95) with extra Vegetables ($3.95) while I went with Filet Mignon (medium rare) and Lobster ($36.95). Both came with Fried Rice and Veggies prepared right in front of our faces. The lobster and scallops was 3 stars while the meat was either 3 or 4 stars.

Our teppanyaki chef was ok. He did the usual skit of beating heart-shaped rice, flying eggs, popping broccoli in the direction of kid's mouths, squirting free sake into the adult's mouths, and a flaming onion volcano. By far, the most exciting part of the performance was the massive flame he spread across the grill to clean it and wake us up at the beginning ... check out the pic to see the huge fire.

If you're keeping score, well, good on ya, mate ... because my gut tells me the food is really just a-ok 3 stars and the performance was as well, but somehow the sum is greater than its parts ... making Kyoto Sushi Steakhouse 4 stars overall.",Positive,Good,Reasonable
329,"I feel kind of bad for Gramercy Grill. What was once a bustling and majorly popular neighborhood spot is now a sad, barren and outdated restaurant that badly needs a thoughtful refresh. My dad chose this spot for his early birthday brunch and so we made unnecessary reservations for 10am on a Sunday. We were the only ones in the restaurant from 10am-11:30am. 

The manager was absolutely sweet and lovely, but my food totally lacked flavor and didn't make me want to keep going back for more. Both my mom and I had the ratatouille omelette (it has peppers and eggplant) and even with the added pepper we agreed that we probably could make something better ourselves. It came with roasted potatoes, which were a little over cooked and overly salty. 

My dad did enjoy his smoked salmon with capers scramble though. And we really appreciated the complementary banana bread. We were confused as to why the menu said ""more banana bread for 50 cents"". It turns out that they used to serve it automatically, but stopped because people wouldn't eat it. Now you just have to ask. 

Their lunch and dinner menu consists of a ton of ""2 for $23.95 specials"". Total change from what the menu was like before, which I remember being a little more upscale. The menu consists of way too many options in my opinion. 

If they way to start thriving again, I highly suggest revamping and shortening their menu and looking into a renovation.",Positive,Moderate,Undefined
330,"Downtown Vancouver, WA has a classic Small-Town-Main-Street vibe ... all literally on Main Street. Hidden among the small shops and restaurants is Main Event Sports Grill. Main Event should be your main event for any trip to Main Street ... thanks to an upscale and relaxed vibe, lots of TVs with sports, and a decent Micro Brew selection. 

Still not convinced? Ok, how about some awesome Happy Hour deals twice daily: 3:00 - 7:00 pm and 10:00 pm to close? What, you still need more reasons to go? Alright, how about some free Truffle Fries with Yelp Check-in? Ya, that got me, too. Who's gonna turn down Happy Hour and FREE Truffle Fries? Not me.

Fresh Squeezed IPA ($4.5) - 4 stars
The draft beer selection at Main Event is a mix of local micro breweries and popular suds. I opted for the Deschutes Brewery (Bend, OR) Fresh Squeezed IPA. It's an American IPA with 3 types of Malt and plenty of Citra and Mosaic Hops. I loved it so much I ordered it again at another place just a week later.

BLT Wedge Salad ($5 HH/$9 Regular) - 4.5 stars
If you're looking for the best happy hour deal for value, get the BLT Wedge Salad at a $4 discount ... plus you can pretend you're eating/drinking healthy by having a salad. Sure, it's like a 1000 calories thanks to Bleu Cheese Dressing, Bacon, Tomato Bits, Balsamic Glaze, and crumble pieces of Bleu Cheese, but, at least, they are Yummy and Cheesy Calories.

Truffle Fries ($5 HH/$7 Regular) - 4 stars
I probably would of ordered this even if it wasn't free. Seriously. I love the mix of thin Fries with Chives, Oregano, Parmesan, Sea Salt, and Truffle Oil. If you've never downloaded the Yelp App, take this as a truffle-tastic reason to do so. Don't believe me, check out the pic of those fries and you'll be convinced.

Jalapeno & Bacon ""Poppers"" ($6) - 4 stars
I could of easily enjoyed a full meal by sticking to the Happy Hour deals, but that ended once I saw one of the specials featured Cream Cheese, Roasted Jalapenos, and Bacon wrapped in a Crispy Wonton with a side of Marionberry Sauce. An order is four small jalapenos that aren't very spicy and provide quite a flavor explosion of sweet 'n heat thanks to the berry sauce, cream cheese, and jalapenos. Oh, and don't forget it's got Bacon which makes everything better.

So, a couple beers, the poppers, that huge salad, and those filling fries totally wiped out any hopes I had of getting the Peanut Butter Burger ($12). I was stuffed ... contented, buzzed, and stuffed. If I get the chance to make it back to the Main Event, I'm bringing friends so they can help share the HH deals and allow me to try the PB Burger or a Garlic Burger.",Neutral,Good,Reasonable
331,"* Cr??me br??l??e specialist *

I love when places specialize in particular dishes. 

While many restaurants have excellent dessert programs, frequently the best desserts are at places that specialize in just desserts.  

And among dessert specialists even better if they specialize in a particular type of dessert.  

Enter crackle creme - a little cafe specializing in cr??me br??l??e.  Yes, they have a few distractions such as waffles and coffee.  But the focus here is clearly on the variety of cr??me br??l??e.

I saw coconut pandan as an option, and I just had to order it.  I haven't had a good coconut pandan custard in a long time, and I've never had one in br??l??e form.

After ordering the coconut pandan cr??me br??l??e ($5) the single person working behind the counter quickly grabbed it out of the fridge, added sugar and started torching it.

I have a pet peeve when it comes to anything torched with butane - I frequently taste the butane if the person using it doesn't keep the torch at the proper distance (I'm looking at you Minami and Miku with your butane flavoured aburi sushi!).  Thankfully no such issue here.  Clearly the benefit of a specialist.  The sugar was perfectly torched and not a single hint of butane.  

Cracking into the sugar yielded a rich creamy cr??me.  No signs of runny thinness. Each bite was perfectly textured with just the right amount of pandan and coconut flavour.  It brought back memories of some of the best coconut pandan custards I've had in Southeast Asia.

I opted for a latte and homemade granola and yogurt and it satisfied. A parfait of greek yogurt with perfect, freshly made granola. So delicious and satisfying.

I dont find any of their food too greasy, which is always a gem in my books when it comes to dim sum. Their egg tarts and steamed sponge cakes are excellent choices for dessert.

Come for the coffee but leave with a cheesecake!

Yesss, people! Those delicious cheesecakes are a MUST. I was torn to have to choose between the many flavors that they have here. I wish I wasn't so disgruntled about my waistline, because I could have stored about 7 of those delicious thangs in my hotel and ate them during my vacation. 

I'm such a phatty! But I can't help it when there are places like Trees Organic Coffee teasing me. 

Trees Organic Coffee is known as the BEST coffee shops in the downtown Vancouver area. Be prepared for the morning rush, the coffee addicts are rushing to make sure they have their daily crack before heading to work. They have their specialty coffee: Latte, Cappuccino, Mocha and Caramel Latte in either a size: Tall, Grande or Trees. They also specialize in specialty drinks such as: Hot chocolate, plain milk, steamed milk. Right now, they have some exciting ""summertime favorites"" which are: Fruit smoothies, Cappuchillo (a tasty coffee frappe) and Italian Soda or Italian Cream Soda. A little bit for everyone to enjoy! 

But, let's talk about what they are known for! Yes, Honey! Those delicious cheesecakes that you can spot as soon as you walk in! Those cheesecakes are to die for, literally! Don't let the price of $7 steer you the wrong way. I thought about the price as well and nearly walked out the door, until my stomach said, ""Nooooo"". They have many varieties of flavors from:  white and dark chocolate and maple walnut, just to name a few. I appreciated that the lovely lady staff let me sample all these different flavor cheesecakes, since I was indecisive. Trust me-they are not too heave on the stomach and are quite filling. Not too sweet, it was just right! They have other food options to choose from, such as: Scone and muffins.

I was excited to try this place since I'm on vacation with my family and this place had great Yelp reviews. The lady at the front told me and my family that they could not seat us for Happy hour because they were no longer ""accepting"" seatings and that it was getting close to being done. I saw clearly that there were 6 open seats at the bar. It was also only 5pm. There was one hour left of a two hour happy hour. I asked to wait for an opening but she said no. I didn't want to make a fuss so I sat down for the full dinner menu. 

The dinner was delicious. 5 stars for the food. Really. The porchetta is delicious - only offered Sunday with limited amount. I highly highly recommend it. As were the crispy Brussel sprouts, seafood pappardelle, and chicken. Perfectly prepared. My waitress was also awesome.

However, during the dinner, they filled every one of those empty happy hour seats I had seen when I came in. I have never been turned away from happy hour before in my life since it's a first come first serve kind of deal. They wouldn't even let us wait for spots to open up. I couldn't help but feel whether it was a personal issue or whether my parents were not ""hip"" enough for that section. For me to give a one star when the food is 5 stars, it takes a lot.

I think some of the problem is that the interior is to plain.  Kind of like the one on MLK.  If the owner won't go to the effort to warm the place up maybe the food suffers to?  Maybe the staff is to depressed by the interior?  Or there are studies that show people perceive the food better when its well presented.  

I do know that my Cinnamon Crusto's were greasy with almost no cinnamon sugar.  I think the company has taken to pre-making these and the product suffers,   Orders at all the branches used to have a good covering of cinnamon sugar,  now not as much.

The good folks from Workshop in North Van have now opened up this sister location in Vancouver also offering an all vegetarian menu. They aren't serving the delicious vegetarian ramen from the Workshop, but have a similar selection of grocery items on the shelves. The menu itself is a bit narrower, and the primary food focus is on udon noodles. 

They charge a base of $7.99 for simple noodles and then you add toppings of your choice ($2 for each protein, $1.50 for each veggie). I tried the ramen egg and kale udon ($11.49 total).

The broth tasted like a good quality konbu base to me, although it was slighter sweeter than I typically prefer. The noodles seemed like a high quality dried udon. The type you typically find at good Japanese grocery stores that import from Japan - not the typical mushy ones available many other places. They were cooked perfectly and still retained a nice chew. The kale was tender and blended well with the broth and noodles. The ramen egg was competently done, with a soft yolk and a slight soy flavour. 

Overall it was a respectable simple bowl of noodles.

Sushi Ville, home of the budget sushi rolls which always had WAAAAYYYYY too much sauce on them closed in this location.  There has been a rebirth with the recent opening of Sushi Howe.

I had the B Combo ($9.75) which included a bincho maki, california roll, and dynamite roll.  I had forgotten how they used so much sauce at the previous restaurant here, as it had been years since I had been. But I remembered once the plate arrived.

They had a very generous portion of each of the rolls.  The bincho maki was presented artfully in a flower shape with fresh tasting bincho being the star. The california roll had a generous amount of fake crab, a very thinly sliced avocado, and some cucumber for good measure.  The dynamite roll was quite large, and incredibly oversauced. I am NOT a fan of the sauce. The roll itself had a generous amount of fake crab, fried shrimp, and fried yam.  

The complimentary miso soup was strong and not overly salty. It had little bits of tofu as well.

Saw this new truck pop up, and it seems it is being run by the Yo-Bones Catering company. The truck specializes in BBQ offering up pulled brisket, pork and chicken sandwiches with some sides.

I tried out the BBQ Chicken sandwich ($8). The chicken was a bit dry, did not have much smoke flavour at all. The slaw was rather bland and simply added a little bit of moisture. The sandwich relied pretty heavily on the sauce for both moisture and taste. They seem to know this and provide extra bottles of the sauce on the edge of the truck for those that need to add more than they provide. 

I'm a BBQ purist. I like my BBQ to not need sauce, and then just have sauce as an extra hint of spice and flavour to taste. But this version required the sauce, and in fact relied on it to carry the sandwich. The chicken itself could have been replaced with something else and it would likely taste exactly the same because the primary flavour profile was the sauce.

Overall, I won't be returning.",Undefined,Undefined,Reasonable

It's in a very small, obscure part of town. It actually looks more like a take out/delivery place because its so small, with a few tables inside that can sit maybe under 20 people. There were only 2 employees when we came.

They sell slices. Looking at them, they didn't look appetizing so we chose the option of ordering our own pizzas. Looking at the menu thoroughly, and seeing how bizarrely Expensive it was, we still ordered a few pizzas and sides for me and my friends. While waiting and chatting it up, I went to go to the washroom. Big mistake. It smelled like no one has cleaned it for a month. It also smelled strongly of weed. Either that or a skunk just happened to pass by and spray just inside the washroom. But this is not all.

When you go to the bathroom, you'd be able to see part of their kitchen. If you walk just a few more steps, you'd be in the kitchen. The best part, you can hear kitchen conversations. The conversation went about like this, ""Fuck just make another one,  reheat that old one and serve it"" At this point I stuck my head into where the kitchen is. 

Needless to say, it looked like a kitchen from a kitchen nightmare show. The floor was covered in what looked like flour and cheese, and one area looked like there was a can of tomato sauce exploded on the floor. Not to mention the chef was wearing the filthiest looking apron I've ever seen and was wiping his prep area with the filthiest looking rag I've ever seen. This is where my food was going to be put on. I still shudder at the thought of it. There was also a burnt pizza on the side which I am assuming was our pizza. 

Upon returning to my friends, one of my companions said that one employee was looking at us weird and took one of the pizzas from the case they were selling slices from. A few minutes later we were served a slightly warm pizza, exactly what was taken from the case. Slightly suspect? The other pizzas came way later. 

We sent back more than a few plates and utensils because they still had some food stuck in them.

The food. The wings we ordered were still cold in the middle. The pizza looks like pizza I've had in Italy. It tasted okay. Though for the price, I was expecting more toppings than what I got. Especially since I paid for more toppings to be put on, which was also Expensive. They also got our order wrong a few times, the chef came to us to apologize. This is where we found out that he smelled like weed and cigarettes.

All in all, because I've seen the kitchen and the person making the food I would never come back and order from this place. I would have expected more, especially because I paid a whole lot more. For okay tasting food. Not worth it.",Undefined,Bad,Expensive

Draft Beers are $3.50 for HH, so I opted for a Phriem IPA. It wasn't very ""hoppy"" so I wasn't very ""happy."" (2 stars) After a few pints, I switched to Dry Fly Gin & Tonic to give this Spokane-distilled gin a shot. It's a smooth gin that could use more juniper bite. (3 stars)

Gorgonzola Cheesecake Appetizer ($10)
That's right ... Cheesecake for an appetizer. I luv the way the executive chef thinks. This rich, creamy, and cheesy cheesecake comes with rustic Bread and was so good I had to share ... so, I did with a barmate.  (4 stars)

Sizzling Forest Mushrooms ($10)
A hot plate of sizzlin' mushrooms filled the entire room with the smell of garlic and jealousy. The wild mushroom blend was so good ... that I didn't dare share. This is a must-order. (5 stars)

Smoked Chicken and Corn Chowder ($5) 
For 5 bucks, I thought why not. The smokiness and creaminess of the chowder was ok, although, I'd love it if it was even creamier and smokier. (3 stars)

Tillamook White Cheddar Burger ($12) 
With so many great entree options, this was the toughest choice. A pic on Yelp convinced me to go with this cheeseburger ... besides anything Tillamook is awesome. The thick beef patties and white cheddar oozing from all sides were cheesy burger happiness. (4 stars)

Chocolate Mousse Cake
Of course, I didn't need dessert, but this simply looked too good to pass up. I should of skipped it. I would of preferred the chocolate cake if they moussed up the cake instead of being so thick and firm. (2 stars)

Besides the mushrooms, the best course of the meal was the bartender. Can't remember her name after so many drinks, but she rocks ... and rolls. Love her.

349,"I always judge a bakery by the quality of its croissants. They're ubiquitous, and as for me, I can't say no to a stick of butter first thing in the morning.

Walking in to Purebread, you're immediately witness to a mile-high pile of carb-laden goodies that range from specialty breads and baked goods to savory treats that could serve as either breakfast or a picnic lunch. If George Clooney himself walked into Purebread as you're first seeing this vision, even he wouldn't upstage the carb mothership in front of you.

Oddly, despite all of the butter bombs on hand, it's easy to go awry. My butter croissant and my dining partner's savory croissant both lacked a good rise and were seeping with butter. Even as Instagram-only material, these wouldn't pass muster. Typically, a croissant would be more puffed and golden on the outside, giving way to soft, pillowy layers that pull apart gingerly like a ribbon. Instead of closing my eyes and being fiendishly delighted by perfect, flaky, light-as-air laminated dough, this was like munching on day-old bread from the discount bin, a few bites that were average, if that, and based on a scan of other reviewer photos, ours was not a one-off problem.

The bakery attracts a crowd of locals and tourists with a million things that sound and look delightful. Bread varieties are extensive and include hazelnut fig, sour cherry chocolate, rustic baguettes, and olive rosemary, among others. More substantial (i.e. hot) breakfast items are also available including a bacon and egg brioche that diners at a nearby table seemed to enjoy. For those coming in purely to satisfy a sweet tooth, there are chocolate cakes, brownies, cheesecake, and meringues.

At Purebread, keep in mind that things may not be as delicious as they appear. Churning out breads the likes of which you'd see in any number of European boulangeries and cafes it's not, and if you set that bar as your expectation, you'll be disappointed.",Undefined,Moderate,Reasonable
350,"tl;dr: Yes, another pizza review. It was good.

****

My only real ambition in life is to eat as much pizza as possible.

Those of you who read my reviews know that I'm particularly fond of (some might argue obsessed with) Neapolitan pizza. You could say that I'm one wood-fired oven away from serving it out of my own backyard, since it's not easy to find the type done well outside of Naples. Not if you're in Vancouver, apparently.

Via Tevere is named after the street in Naples where the patriarch of the restaurant's ownership team was raised. Living in Naples, you see a few things every day: crime, a statue of Jesus on every block, and lots of pizza. Unlike picture-perfect Tuscany, it's a slice of real life. And if you can't find a life-transforming pizza margherita in the area, you probably ought to give up eating.

The pizza at Via Tevere is a thing of beauty and would hold its own against any pizzeria or street cart in Naples selling authentic pizza Napoletana. Rustic and simple, a bubbling margherita pie is delivered uncut which preserves the milky center. Yes all you ""wet pizza"" haters--this one's not for you. That's fine, more for me.

If you listen closely enough, the background music and cacophony of happy diners give way to Vivaldi's 'Four Seasons' playing in your head as you take a first bite, the pizza freshly removed from the baby blue Stefano Ferraro oven situated center-stage in the open floor plan. Just 90 seconds in this puppy creates a pizza with a perfectly leopard-spotted cornicione (crust) topped with sweet San Marzano tomatoes from the Campania region of Italy, milky fior di latte mozzarella, fresh leaves of basil, and a swirl of olive oil.

The nuances that separate an extraordinary Neapolitan pizza from an ordinary one are subtle, but important. It's all about aroma, taste, and texture, and Via Tevere's version was the perfect amalgam. The crust should have a certain chew and the wet ingredients--the tomatoes and the mozzarella--need just the right consistency. Over-work the dough, and the crust lacks the slight crunch and pull that I'm looking for. Apply too little of the toppings and you end up with a center that's dry and lacking. Leave the pizza in the oven just five seconds too long and it goes from blistering char to burnt. If all I can taste is salt, you're trying to pack an umami punch but are actually masking the sweet and milky flavors that make this pizza so great, plus I'll be dying of thirst in about an hour.

Collectively, when done right, the aroma elicits a memory of eating this same thing hundreds of times in the place where it was born.

A pizza triumph like this is rare, but meaningful. The price to pay for this glory comes in a lengthy wait since, annoyingly, there are no reservations and you're seated on a first-come, first-served basis. That said, if there is any restaurant worth waiting for, it's this one.",Positive,Moderate,Reasonable
351,"* Second location *

Pallet has opened up a second location right on Kingsway and the corner of Knight. It has a very different feel than their original location over on Semlin. The original location feels industrial, with the roastery visible down the stairs. This one feels more like a typical cafe.

They offered a choice of two different beans for the espresso. I chose the Columbian, which was a lighter roast.  The espresso ($2.90) had to be pulled twice by the barista because she didn't like the first pull. The one I was served was properly pulled (thank you for the quality control!), with a good crema. 

I find Pallet's roasts to be quite variable. Sometimes I'm really not a fan, but this one was very smooth, with good acidity, and not overly roasted.  A very nice espresso!

Bonus is that they serve it with a small glass of sparkling water on the side. Nice touch!",Negative,Good,Undefined
352,"Ok so Chinatown - Vancouver is old, dirty, grungy, smelly, bizzare, sad, poor & more! 

Coming down here will have you asking yourself, 'why on earth am I here?'

I will write about the 'good' as we go along a little later - so please have an open mind & keep on reading.

Like most Chinatowns ie - San Fran & Manhattan - they do leave one feeling like  - a lot is still to be desired! 

Holding onto the past of a bygone era, can be a stretch in today's fast moving times! 

Given Chinatowns symbolic historical significance - however, there's a difference between classic beautiful history vs old, neglected & just plain abandoned history!

Dilapidated buildings, dirty streets, rampant open drug use (you will see people using needles) & drug paraphernalia, homelessness, nasty rude disgusting piss smells along with other vileness coming from the alleys, many shops are closed - even pre Coronavirus, are examples of what one will experience here! 

Do you really see yourself coming here to get your Ginseng, Ginger & other traditional Chinese medicines!??

Do not park your fancy car in this area at night - maybe even not during the day!

A common site curbside is broken window glass! Park at your own risk - ALERT be warned!!!

The two main malls - International Village Mall & Chinatown Plaza will leave you with a feeling of utter pity over this sadness!

The vagabond of characters hanging around the International Village, will cause you to clutch your wallet!!!

Check out this hard hitting reality check about Vancouvers downtown eastside by none other than - Snoop Dogg!

Side note - I have actually never seen him perform live.

Back in 2016 on one of his many trips up here to perform, he flew into YVR Airport & was sent to secondary screening & he cleared customs with no issues.

However, that night when he was driving to perform at Fortune Sound Club, he had the misfortune of turning onto one of Chinatowns notorious alleys on his way to the club, which lead to his rant - check out this clip!

https://www.straight.com/blogra/680536/snoop-dogg-takes-drive-down-downtown-eastside-alley-and-has-words-clean-needles-drug

How about the Chinatown merchants banding together & coming up with a plan to spruce up their neighbourhood!??

Involve younger community leaders & seek input from them but most of all - listen to them!!!!!

Add colour, brighter signage, play music on the streets, have guidance maps/indicators at every street corner - just do something anything to liven it up - please!

Heck bring back the Neon signs that once vibrated throughout Chinatown giving it life!

Sadly many merchants fled Chinatown years ago, with their businesses to Richmond, Burnaby & other parts of Metro Vancouver.

Doing nothing is really turning our Chinatown into a dinasour relic = heading fast towards extinction - very sad!

For the amount of locals & tourists that do come down to Chinatown for a visit, I seriously wonder how many more do not - as they're too spooked to visit!!! 

Don't believe me - go & take a walk about here - then come back at me!

However, I do ask that you walk on Columbia St, Gore Ave, Hastings St, pause for 15 mins at Hastings & Main, & try the alleyway between Pender & Hastings running between Main & Columbia - I dare you to!!!

Yikes!

Chinatown feels like it's being run by an older generation that will die off without having passed on their talents, knowledge & skills to keep it running.

So all the above was the nasty grungy, grimy part about Chinatown.

Now for the good ..... 

There are several really good restaurants here however, many are still closed due to the Coronavirus hangover!

Some unfortunately will probably never reopen due to bankruptcy.

Check out my reviews for Kissa Tanto, Sai Woo, Juke (Southern styled fried chicken) & Kokomo (for healthy food).

Try New Town Bakery (get your pork steamed buns here - bakery was featured on Netflix - Always Be My Maybe) a very popular joint for locals & tourists.

Also of note - Bao Bei, Chinatown BBQ, Phnom Penh Restaurant & Floata Seafood Restaurant.

Many Chinese seniors make daily pilgrimages to Chinatown for food & social activities.

Cultural History Buffs will be amazed at the architectural structures that takes one back in time.

The Dr Sun Yat-Sen Classical Garden at the Chinese Cultural Centre is quite impressive - if gardens is your thing.

It's super easy to walk around Chinatowns closely linked blocks.

Yes it is safe - but one must be aware of what goes on down here on these streets!

So be aware, be alert, be safe & lookout!!!

It's upsetting to witness this culturally rich historical area go by the wayside!

You might ask with good reason after reading this review - is it worth my time going to Chinatown?

I'd say sure if you have a plan & a purpose for being down there - go for it!

It's raw, it's rough, it's tough & it's all a part of the Downtown Eastside!

353,"On cold rainy evenings, there are few moments that bring me calm serenity like a Sapporo cradled in one hand and chopsticks cradling ramen in the other ... the rush of memories from life in Japan ... and youthful anticipation of what the night ahead will bring ... mixed with the reality of what age and paths have led me here. 

Ramen can be spiritual. Or just dinner. Either way, Kenji's Ramen is one of the best options for Japanese-style bowls of noodle nirvana in Vancouver, WA.

Olivia Z. and me split orders of comfort classics Gyoza (3.5 stars) and Chicken Kara-age (2.5 stars). Neither was worth distracting me from the large bottle of Sapporo Beer.

An extra spicy bowl of Sea Salt Ramen (4 stars) with extra Pork was the gratifying tranquility that Japanese ramen brings one slurp at a time while the spicy heat reminded me that ramen can be bold. Olivia quietly murmured that that the restaurant namesake's Kenji's Ramen with Pork Broth was fine which I'll take as 3 stars.

354,"On our walk through Gastown making our way to Chinatown one morning, we stumbled across Purebread.

When I first walked in, I was overwhelmed by the amount of baked goods on display. Moreover, the aroma of freshly baked breads and pasteries.

This cafe has high ceilings with several tables and   counter top seating. At about 9am on a Saturday, this place was packed. We initially had thoughts of just getting our coffees and pasteries to go, but a table opened up so we sat for a few minutes.

We got a Raspberry Loaf and an Apple Tart. And by the way, the ""Apple Tart"" has a different name but I didn't get to read the whole thing and I wasn't able to take a picture of the sign in front of it either. So for now, it'll be referred to as the Apple Tart. 

The Raspberry Loaf I got was very similar to the Iced Lemon Pound Cake at that Coffeebucks place. Only this one had real raspberries in it. It was good but the frosting was much too sweet. I took it all off and didn't eat it. The Apple Tart was good though. Not very sweet with a light and buttery outside.

I don't know what kind of coffee they served but it was really smooth. It really hit the spot. If I'm ever in the area again, I would go back.",Undefined,Moderate,Undefined

There is WiFi here, which is mandatory not only in a city like Vancouver but in the year 2018, all breakfast places should have WiFi in a metropolitan city.

Orange juice is squeezed fresh and it DOESN'T TASTE LIKE DIABETES IN A CUP. That's right, it's not a sugar rush! Not all oranges squeezed will taste like dessert. Get over it, it's good for you. I ordered a glass and wish I had ordered a second because it was that good.

Recommendations:
 * Chips & Guac
Although twice I got chips that seemed stale/soft, I'm a sucker for fresh avocado mixed with lime juice, jalapenos, cilantro, and onions.

 * Steak Fajitas 
Corn tortillas for me and flour tortillas for my wife whenever we share a pile of tender steak, grilled veggies, fried rice, and black beans.

 * Burrito Ultimo
Sour cream, jack & cheddar cheeses, and rice inside the flour tortilla are the difference makers alongside grilled veggies with steak, chicken, or pork.

 * Enchilado Style
Make even the  most bland of Baja Fresh burritos better by paing the upgrade to smother it with red chile sauce (not spicy), cheese, pico de gallo, and sour cream.

As for the food, well, it is kind of average. We started with an order of Chunky Guacamole ($7.50), split the Fajitas for Two with Steak & Chicken ($28.50), and ended with Churros ($5.99). I'd rank them in this order: Churros, Guac, Fajitas, but my favorite discover that made the fajitas better was a side order of Chile Fritos (Baked Jalapeno) for $0.99 each. Add this to your order if you like to spice things up.

Happy Hour is 7-days a week from 3:00 - 6:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m to close plus all day Sunday. The only discount margarita is the House Lime Margarita ($4.75), but Tap Beers ($3.75) and 8 food items are also available.

362,"As a preface to this review, I'm a Yelper and love to use it to discover new places. I had read the reviews on The Parker prior to my first time going there and knew to either expect a great experience or a terrible experience as the split reviews said. 

As a vegetarian for 18 years, I was really happy to see so many fine dining restaurants opening in the city that offered a menu that catered to me.  I am sorry to say my experience at The Parker was probably one of the worst experiences I have had at a Vancouver restaurant, and I do hope they read these reviews because if they continue to treat customers this way, they will not be in business for very long. 

I had attended The Parker with a group of 9 people that would have ordered all of their entrees and likely 2-3 drinks a piece and would have spent good money at their establishment. 
The issue with their service arose when one person in my party had the audacity to try to order a drink like a rye and coke or a vodka and orange juice.  Here's how it went: 

""I'd like a rye and coke please"" 
""we don't have pop here"" (dead silence while the server fails to suggest an alternative) 
""Ok can I please have a vodka and some juice you may have available?"" 
""We don't have any juice here, none of our products contain refined sugar"" (more awkward dead silence when again, no alternative is offered) 
""Ok, do you have oranges? I could do a vodka with water and some oranges"" 
""We are a sustainable vegetarian restaurant that emphasizes on local cuisine. Oranges are not local"" 
""okay, well I'm looking at your drink menu and I'm not sure which of your drinks would be suitable"" 
""well our list of cocktails are all over 200 years old, so they should be recognizable"" while still failing to suggest an alternative, now he looks like a complete jerk. He even went on to rudely suggest to this person ""there is a grocery store down the street that might cater to your needs more"". 
Eventually he walked away and came back and surprise, there was an orange at the bar that he juiced for my friend's cocktail.  I really doubt this orange was sustainably sourced from the community of Strathcona, or even anywhere near local. 

We decided after 1 drink that we could no longer stay at the establishment.  They were thrilled we were leaving. 

I get it, this server (who I am sure was actually a MANAGER at the restaurant) probably deals with yahoos constantly that don't like to try new things and probably ask the same questions and make the same statements to this guy. The way he responded to my friend told me he was tired of it.  Perhaps a customer service oriented career is not the right place for this man to be working. 
I had spent years training people for customer service and what to do and what not to do. This gentleman is a perfect example of how not to treat people. The way to overcome somebody's objectives is to OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE.  At the first refusal to make my friend's drink, he could have easily suggested something off of their cocktail menu. You do not have the luxury of dealing with agreeable people all the time in any type of people-facing job, and what sets places apart is how they handle people.  Sure, my friend wasn't well versed in what the place was all about but there is absolutely zero excuse for how this situation was handled. The best part was that with 7 of 9 of us there, we were all charged an 18% auto gratuity for 1 drink and a lecture. I am so embarrassed for this place.  Extremely poor form to project such attitude and pretention unnecessarily. 
The fact that based on one person in our party they were happy to see us all leave means they probably will not stay in business long unless they decide to change their customer focus. I have been to several local establishments that focus on local cuisine (such as forage) and the service and messaging was the opposite of this place.",Negative,Moderate,Expensive
363,"U can really share one, except of course, if you accidentally drop 1/2 your sandwich, chips and pickle on the ground. The cones ""cups"" that double as plates are environmentally friendly but not exactly conducive for lap balancing. I can see how the cones keep the chips warm tho--not that I had many chips left after I ""klutzed"" out on my first visit, of course. 

They did give me a new pickle, which was a nice gesture. I decided to give my sammie a 5 second rule. But approx. 5 seconds after that, pigeons were eating all of my chips off the same ground that I'd basically eaten my sandwich from, and that part was sorta gross. Here I was, breaking that  #245 city bylaw: Thou shalt not feed pigeons. This is the same law that I quote to ignorant tourists when they insist on feeding sea gulls all around me while I'm trying to enjoy my GI lunch. I know I digress, but now, you also know this valuable community bylaw. And believe me, it sure comes in handy at times. 

The only caveat with Mom's is you seem to wait quite awhile for a grilled cheese, and that's on a seemingly-less-than-busy cold day. I can't imagine how the hot days must be in that respect. Gluten free is at least two bucks more, so I couldn't jump onto that foodwagon, and sodas were pricey food-truck-and-I-don't-even-get-a-glass prices. 

Everything else has already been said about this place: it's great. Apparently, if you don't get the tomato soup or the bacon you're an absolute fool, so I will try that next time.

364,"Much like art, pizza is subjective to each person's tastes. We all have our favorite pizza genres like New York thin, Chicago deep-dish, or rustic Neapolitan pizza. When it comes to pizza, I'm much more open-minded to modern pizza than I am to modern art ... which led me to visit Vancouver Pizza Company on Main Street in peaceful Vancouver, WA. I came to behold some Pizza masterpieces (Would that make them master-pizzas?) named after some of the world's most renowned artists. 

The pizza crust at Vancouver Pizza Co is a chewy bread disc that went really well with my half Renoir & half Dante medium pizza christened after two legendary Italians. One a poet and the the other an artist ... coming together for one poetic & artistic master-pizza. Neither the Dante nor the Renoir features classic Tomato Sauce which so many expect, so, I get that these two creations may not be for everyone. Pizza's value lies in the taste buds of the pizza holder.

A Renoir Pizza (5 stars) features Creamy Alfredo Sauce with Green Onions, Mushrooms, Bacon, Mozzarella, and huge slices of Fresh Tomatoes on top. Even though I went half/half on the pizza, the Renoir was clearly my favorite and I finished 4 slices of it before even attempting a second slice of the Dante. 

A Dante Pizza (4 stars) has Olive Oil & Garlic with Fajita Chicken, Green Peppers, sliced Pepperoncinis, Pepperoni slices, Feta Cheese, Jack Cheese, with Fresh Garlic, Parmesan, and Romano sprinkle on top. Oh, the Dante was fine, but it was no inferno.

Be sure to take advantage of the Yelp Check-in for a free 1/2 order of Vancouver Pizza's Famous Breadsticks ... which is a full pan of thin bread (choose with or without Cheese). I opted for without cheese and a dipping sauce of Creamy Garlic Dressing. It was easy to taste why the bread is famous.

An advertised local beer was a Belgian Red Ale from nearby West Highland Brewing. It was sweet and spicy at the same time. Worthy of a second round, for sure.

The final piece of genius that made my meal at Vancouver Pizza special was brilliant service with a touch of creativity. The sidewalk patio was busy with people relaxing and enjoying a Summer afternoon, but the lady working the tables kept hustling to make sure everyone was taken care of like a master. Bravo!

Dante's work may be a bit existential and Renoir's art may best be viewed from a distance, but when it comes to Vancouver Pizza Company, my advice is to get up close and personal with either the Dante or Renoir Master-Pizzas.",Undefined,Good,Cheap

366,"I FOUND MY LOST SUSHI CHEF! 

::side note:: Due to the lack of skill presented by some of the non-chefs who are employed in the majority of casual sushi joints in Vancouver, there are very few that I will actually eat in. This is not the case at Tsuki. It's here that I found my lost sushi chef, a man who has worked at many different spots around the city, most notably at my ultimate jam, Sushi Mart, and my favourite drinking sodium-filled izakaya, Zakkushi on Denman. He worked at both at the same time, always smiling, and always, always producing the finest, freshest sushi imaginable. My heart eased as soon as I walked in to see my lost chef working hard behind the counter of Tsuki. /end side note

So how does this lost chef play into the Tsuki sushi? Amazingly. 

The rice, which so very many people have yet to perfect, is perfect here. Not mushy, not too sweet, and with a lovely sheen, it does the rest of the sushi justice. (Rice is the basis of all sushi, after all. Don't mess that noise up.) The sashimi is beautifully cut with many ocean-wise options available (only the brightest, wildest sockeye here, kids), and for the peeps looking for more ridiculous rolls (ie. Caterpillar, Popeye, Monster, et al), they offer a full ""Craft Roll"" section on the menu. Not my jam, but with just as much attention and care poured into the non-traditional rolls as the more classically Japanese ish, my dining partner was more than satisfied. Also, bonus: an entire vegetarian menu is available with very conscious and very delicious options. I'd order solely from this and be more than happy.

The modern setting, with its exposed concrete and drop down bulbs, is surprisingly chill without feeling too cold, and the staff are all super friendly without getting all up in my space while I'm trying to eat.

368,"This is the largest Safeway that I have been in, in a while.   First off there is homeless problem around the entrances and in the parking lot area of this store.  The parking lot smells like pee and I think management needs to be more cognizant of those camping out around their store.  The store starts on the second floor and you'll have to take cool criss crossing escalators to get to it. I saw that parking is free for a few hours so you can get your shopping in and then a quick bite at one of those awesome restaurants on Robson.

The hubby and I wandered in here after a stroll on Robson street to pick up a few items that we forgot at home on our last visit down to Vancouver.   The aisles seem endless here, and they do have pretty good prices.  I actually bought a maple tea that I saw at the IGA in Whistler here because it was 50% less.  

The staff is friendly, we asked of where things were instead of hunting them down ourselves and everyone was happy to talk to us even the security guard near the pharmacy. I thought that self checkout was a little confusing.  There is one line for the 6 terminals that's not clearly marked or guided so you can wait for a while in the wrong line then have to go stand in another. A very nice lady let me go in front of her when the clerk dude watching over the area made me go to the back of the line because I was in the wrong one.

If you need something and are staying in the coal harbor area, this is a pretty good place to pick those things up.  I wish we had one of these up in Whistler.

369,"* Decent banh mi, but better nearby options *

I mourn the loss of my favourite banh mi shop, Tung Hing, which just closed recently. Scouting out new options I found that the old Room for Cream cafe was replaced with this grand opening Banh Mi Yen Linh cafe.

Service was very efficient, but perhaps because they weren't very crowded yet.  

The bread was toasted, but was the very processed flour type that was a bit too airy compared to the good more baguette like types at other spots. The mayo was also not that delicious handmade type, and more commercial type. The lemongrass chicken was heated up, but was a bit dry and didn't have noticeable lemongrass. It was more of just a plain chicken breast flavour. The shredded carrots and daikon were not very pickled and quite crunchy. The cucumber was REALLY thinly sliced to the point where you couldn't really even taste it in a combined bite. The cilantro was fresh and flavourful.  The jalapenos had good kick.  But overall the flavour profile was missing something to pull it all together. It was a very bland banh mi overall on fairly average bread. 

So overall, it is OK. But considering all of the other nearby options I don't see myself returning anytime soon.",Positive,Moderate,Undefined

- churros were really plain and tasteless (but thanks god the mix of chocolate and mascarpone on the side made up for it) ;

- the music (which is nothing like you could hear in Spain) is really loud and annoying after a little while ;

371,"Very, very disappointed.  We had been meaning to come here for some time because my boyfriend is a big fan of BBQ.  We were out tonight to celebrate our 10 anniversary and thought this would be a good spot for a special occasion.  Boy, were we wrong.

We seated ourselves at the bar, in the best seats in the house, directly across from the kitchen so we could have a good view of where the action was.  Everyone seemed to be in a great mood, laughing and joking and dancing around the kitchen.  I was thinking, ""what a fun place.  This food looks great. Can't wait to taste what they are fixing up"".  We ordered the Texas platter, with brisket, sausage, and spare ribs with potato salad and coleslaw.  We were so entertained by the fact they had a boiler maker section in the cocktail menu, so we each ordered the Hop Scotch, and glass of scotch and a can of a delicious IPA we had already known we love, Bodhizafa from Georgetown.

When the food came, it didn't take us long to realize that this place may talk the talk, but they certainly cannot walk the walk.  The brisket was incredibly dry and tasteless.  The sausage was mediocre at best.  The ribs were good. Smokey and flavorful.  The one thing they did right.  The coleslaw was almost inedible, wet cabbage. the potato salad was more mayo than potato. The homemade BBQ sauce was basically tomatoes paste with sugar.  Everything (ribs aside) was lacking in flavor and overpriced.  The worst part of the evening was yet to come.

After sipping on my scotch and IPA for a little while, I noticed a fleck of something at the bottom of my glass.  I shrugged it off and assumed it was a piece of coleslaw.  However, after fishing it out with my fork, I realized that it was blue and metallic.  The waiter, which according to our check was named Kimba, asked how everything was, and I said, ""fine but I found some metal in my scotch."" which I then preceded to show him.  His response was, ""Well, did you die?"".  Taken aback by his rudeness, I told him no, but you might want to check that your dishwasher is not contaminating your liquor glasses because plastic in the scotch is undesirable. He replied that it must have come off of the scotch bottle.  When I said ""I see"", he replied with ""What do you want? Free food for life?"" and laughed and laughed as he walked away.  I looked at my boyfriend with flames in my eyes, asking if he really just said that.  Insinuating that a customer is bringing plastic in the drinks up for the sole purpose of getting something for free is not only incredibly rude, but completely infuriating. 

Kimba, you may be one of the worst servers I have encountered in my 30 years on this earth.  If a customer brings a valid complaint to your attention, the absolute last thing you should do is go on the defense and claim they have ulterior motives.  You (and in part, you restaurants sub-par food) ruined my special occasion out and I will remember your exceptional rudeness every time I pass this crummy restaurant.  I will be sure to spread the world of you despicable behavior, and hope that sometime soon, you find a job where you do not interact with the public.

373,"* Hidden overpriced goodies *

This spot which used to be a Taiwanese restaurant changed over recently to become a location of the Kung Fu Noodle chain.  So I figured I'd pop in and give it a try.  

The variety of items on the menu came from several regions of China, with a heavy influence from Shaanxi in the selections available.  

The noodle soups are priced on the high end for what is offered, which is always something that sits funny with me for a noodle shop.  

I ordered the ""kung fu"" lamb noodle soup ($12.99) from the very friendly waitress. It is unusual to have such friendly service in a Chinese restaurant so that was a pleasant surprise.

The food was prepared quickly and arrived in a large bowl.  First impression was decent visually, with a large mound of cilantro on top:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/kung-fu-noodle-vancouver-2?select=zDv1e_sRabdYF1HdlRb4_g

Digging into the bowl a bit turned up all sorts of pleasant surprises like goji berries, thinly sliced yuba strips, several types of fungus, lily buds, quail eggs, vermicelli, and of course lamb and the hand sliced noodles.  The broth was a bit bland, but thankfully they had both chili oil and a smoked chili condiment available to season to taste.  When adding those everything balanced out quite nicely - I particularly liked the smoked chili condiment.  The lamb pieces were cooked nicely and were quite tender. There were not many of them though sadly.  The quail eggs (2 of them hidden deep in the bowl) were at a pleasant doneness with the yolks still being a bit runny instead of overcooked and hardened.  The goji berries had soaked up the broth and rehydrated nicely. The yuba was fresh tasting, and the fungus and lily buds added both texture and rich flavours. The broth overall did not have an excessive MSG flavour either - nice.  Photos:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/kung-fu-noodle-vancouver-2?select=dyrvzh6qtRFkuwafGVcHWw and http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/kung-fu-noodle-vancouver-2?select=8Vxo5TIM7RH_2UdeHeujhw

The two things that would have brought this up to a 4 star dish for me were:  1)  Having the noodles slightly less cooked. They were a little past the point of proper cooking and getting too soft.  (And that is by my taste which prefers noodles to the softer side in this type of dish) 2) Having a better value on the pricing. $12.99 is a bit high for what was given.

So while the soup had lots of hidden goodies, and I enjoyed it, there is still a bit of room for improvement to get things up to a 4 or 5 star level.  Perhaps with a little tweaking they can make it!",Positive,Moderate,Undefined

Because I was with my family of 4, we ordered many items to share (although it's weird that I always end up being the one to finish everything.  The life of a dad, I guess).  Some of the items we got were Wonton Noodle Soup, BBQ Pork Noodle Soup, Chinese Broccoli, dumpings, and Siopao (oh hey, look, a Filipino dish!).  While nothing stood out, all were very good.  Simple, fresh, and tasted like homemade cooking......if I grew up Chinese, that is.  We also had some pastries to go, which I didn't take pictures of, but were good (in other words, I scarfed them down in the car while my wife was sleeping).

377,"I'm going to echo what so many others here have - The owner of Solly's is HORRIBLE!!! This woman is an absolute nightmare. The way she berates her employees and exudes sheer malice towards them is shameful. She should retire and either sell her operation or hire someone who is actually competent to run the place.

I'd like to preface this next paragraph by stating that I've been a customer of this place for many years and that the food and more specifically, the baking is indeed excellent. I can not however in good conscience continue to support this tyrant. I have observed this troubling behavior now with increasing frequency over the years. The store is very frequently short-staffed as they have great difficulty retaining new staff for more than a couple weeks at a time. The effect this has on the business is glaringly obvious... chronic line-ups, disgruntled service, shabby appearance of the store, declining food quality, the list goes on. Without exaggeration, I've probably seen no less than 3 or 4 dozen new employees working at Solly's that I only ever saw more than once.

Today was the final straw for me, and I will never go back again. As I spent 25 minutes in the line TO PAY, I got to hear all kinds of acerbic nonsense flow from this troubled woman's mouth. She was openly complaining to a customer about how hard it is to find employees and she was almost gloating about hiring temporary foreign workers, but that it was frustrating waiting for their visas to come through. When the next shift of staff came in to start, she greeted them by belittling them vocally and getting angry at THEM for the size of the line, demanding they get the line size down (She spent 2 minutes doing that while I stood there, card in hand waiting for her to actually input my order into the till). She also openly complained about the hardships of living in Vancouver, almost as if her company didn't generate $1-5 million annually (from Glassdoor). The irony is there is a large sign posted on one of the coolers telling customers to treat the employees with respect, talk about an empty gesture.

I doubt she reads these reviews, but in the off chance that happens, here's some advice.

A. Stop being a miserable b****. 
B. Hire a freaking manager.
C. Stop micro-managing your staff and treat them with respect! Without them you wouldn't be able to operate your business. I'm just speculating here but I can guess you should probably pay them more too.

Let me state my pedigree:  I have been eating southern fried catfish, caught fresh from the Mississippi river in southeast missouri, since I could eat.  And every few months, I try ordering, and I never find it.  THAT IS UNTIL NOW.  

Our group of 4 wander over to Mama's on a Saturday afternoon to grab a bite.  It was that odd hour between lunch and dinner.  We stepped into the restaurant that looks a bit rundown.  The place made me feel a bit nostalgic for the little dives in the South.  That's right, the best southern food is always found at a little rundown restaurant in the South served not by a highfalutin chef, but someone's grandma or granddad.

I'm enjoying the cool tunes of everything from Bill Withers to Van McCoy, when the proprietor, Joseph, steps up to tell us about his menu.  He apologizes that the dinner menu is not available but assures us that fried catfish is offered all day.  I ask him, with intensity and arrogance, is it real southern catfish?  Joseph tells me he gets his catfish from Missouri.  I said, alright, fried catfish and fried okra.  

Joseph proudly brings out the BEST FRIED CATFISH & FRIED OKRA, since I've been to the bootheel of Missoura.  The cornmeal breading was perfect.  Both the catfish and okra were fried to perfection.  Don't ask me why NO ONE can figure this out, but JOSEPH KNOWS THE FORMULA.

The goods: 
- Hamachi oshi (seared): hands down the highlight of the meal for me. It was wonderfully seared, making for a delicious smoky taste and I loved the addition of the sprouts on top. So warm and comforting.

Korean grocery stores are never near anywhere I live and was super excited to pick stuff up especially in their skincare section on the last trip down to Vancouver. Unfortunately this is the most ridiculously priced H Mart that I have ever been in. Products that I normally get online or in Honolulu are well over 50% less than what they are selling their items in here for. Granted they do have a full array of Korean brands that are happening right now but to think that I can just go online and get everything for half off prevented me from touching anything. The second floor is for produce and groceries and this area isn't any better for pricing. The ready-made banchan food is way over priced, and you don't get the quantities that you would at other H Marts. The only two areas that I thought were reasonably priced was the candy and meat section.

My wife misses Japanese food even when she's not hungry.

It was about 30-minutes before closing and nearly empty; however, the hostess and service we over-the-top friendly and eager to please.

We ordered a pitcher of Red Truck Lager from the local brewery. The beer was a good light summer match for sushi. A plate of Fried Calamari and Agedashi Tofu (3 stars) followed. That might of been been better served separate with different sauces.

The one selection I would recommend from Kamei Royale was the sashimi and if there was one fish sashimi that was fresher and yummier than the rest, it was the Sockeye Salmon Sashimi. It came as part of selection of Sashimi including Yellowtail and other fish I forget, but the one unforgettable choice was the Sockeye. I'd get a whole order of just this if I went back there today.

Rounding out our meal were some sushi rolls. A square Salmon Oshizushi was interesting while both a Dynamite Roll and California Roll were just filler. Get the rolls if you don't really care for Japanese food.

When we arrived on a Saturday noon, their patio was maybe only half filled and the bar was filling up to watch the World Cup on their big screens.  The spot is definitely on the industrial rustic trend with it's use of big planks of wood, exposed unpolished raw metal details, and the usual Einstein bulbs.  It is a pretty big spot and the tables are nicely spread out.  Even if all the tables were taken, there is zero concerns about hitting another table or overhearing their conversation.   There was maybe only 4 other tables with us that day and service was friendly and solid.  We didnt experience any of the poor service mentioned in other reviews but we also didnt do a dinner.

Their menu is their take on comfort food but with a focus on being locally sourced.  So no fake syrups (its real maple syrup) and their eggs are supposed to be free run.  It takes all the classic brunch dishes but just does a bit of a twist on it... French Toast gets crusted in Frosted Flake for a sweet crunch addition and then topped with hot crispy chicken.   Who needs Chicken and Waffles when you can take it further it Frosted Flake French Toast.  

Greens n Grains - A nice light salad that was filled a lot of great vegetables and tons of goat cheese to add a tangy note and a creamy bite. The addition of the grains kept me decently full before heading over to a nearby spot to grab a doughnut.  For all those wanting to keep it light or looking more of a vegetarian offering, this would be a great dish.  Nicely dressed with a sesame vinaigrette and offering pops of flavour from the goat cheese, fresh peas, and candied pecans... this is a solid salad. 4/5

Fried Chicken on Frosted Flake French Toast - Going to admit that this is just over the top... food coma ready?  The fried chicken was a healthy helping that was hot and crispy.  A solid fried chicken as it wasn't dried out and seasoned well.  You can dip it in the chicken gravy for an extra burst of salt and chicken flavour or go all out and drown it in the maple syrup.  As for the french toast, you get 4 good sized pieces that had that extra sweet crunch of the cereal.  The custard did soak the bread nicely.  I think you didnt really need to add the maple syrup for extra flavour but who can say no to maple syrup.  Not this Canadian.  4/5

The food on the other hand is...well kind of bland.  It's ok but nothing great.  I had a hot chocolate that tasted watered down and a biscuit that was just ok.  My friend seemed to like his breakfast though.

The food seems to be of the big portions of so-so food variety.  I know for some that its all about portion size and for them this is probably a decent option.

Service here was just barely better then rude.  we were only one of two tables but still had a hard time getting her attention.  my water glass never got refilled and when we did have her attention she just acted like she was going through the motions...  

The cook seemed nice though,  my friends biscuits and gravy wasn't warm enough and when the cook was out front he asked for it to be warmed up and the cook was friendly and fixed it quickly.

Verdict-I hope I don't get taken back.",Positive,Undefined,Undefined
390,"If at first you succeed, don't f it up the second time. 

Our first visit to Pho Sen was a pleasant dining discovery of Vietnamese-style favorites on old Highway 99. It was so convenient and comforting that we came back a week later. That meal wasn't nearly as yummy, so, I'm not a 100% sure what the real rating for Pho Sen should be. For now, I'm a 4-star fan and will be back because the third time is supposed to be the charm, right?.

I've tried the Pho Tai (round steak pho) and Pho Tai Chin (round steak and well-done brisket pho). The Pho Tai on the first visit was really delish with thin soft snow-white noodles in a refreshing salty broth flavored to taste with extra jalape??o slices and fresh lime juice. The Pho Tai Chin served for the second meal was similar ... except the pho noodles were a single over-cooked lump. I should of returned the bowl, but just used my chopsticks to pinch apart the noodles. So, the 4-star pho on our first visit was a 2-star disappointment on the second.

Our favorite food from Pho Sen so far has been the Curry Chicken with French Bread (rice is an alternate option) Soaking up the spicy curry sauce with bread is fun while the tender chicken was filling. Another recommendation is the Thai Spicy Squid Salad with cooked naked squid served in a spicy Thai-inspired sauce.

The only items I'll skip entirely at Pho Sen are the Banh Mi sandwiches. I tried a Grilled Pork Banh Mi that was a dry bread roll light on meat, veggies, and flavor. I ended up not eating half of the bread cause it was so hard while picking at the meat scraps.

Re-reading this review, I'm wondering why I'm rounding up to 4 stars. I guess the reasons are the family-style friendly service, the location in an otherwise desolate restaurant wasteland, and the initial bowl of pho, comfort-food curry with bread, and spicy squid. Let's hope the third time really is a charming success for Pho Sen and they don't f it up even worse.",Positive,Good,Undefined
391,"Ciao! 

Pepino's located close to Hastings on Commercial Drive or simply - The Drive - is a kinda welcome spot before progressing onwards up into the heart of - Vancouvers aptly named - Little Italy. 

Pepino's opened in 2018 taking over the exact spot once occupied by the iconic Nick's Spaghetti House, which ran for 62 years!!! 

There is a rustic classic feel to this joint right from the entrance door (feels like your entering someones house) to the complete interior - dark furniture, wood tables & old paintings on the walls. 

It truly feels like a step back in time - did Godfathers (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse."") ever meet here for dinner back in the day!?! LOL. 

Mangiare! 

We had - Chicken Piccata (a 1/2 chicken on its own in a wicked caramalised sauce), Lobster Gnoochi - special (to die for absolutely delightful!), Crimini Mushrooms & a hearty amazing Tiramisu (made in house). 

Our waitress was friendly & helpful. 

A small restaurant with tables close together however, with much heart - come ready to relax with everyone else & yes even families with small children - all chowing down on their spaghetti - happy as can be. 

As we were leaving a man we chatted with, told us he'd been here several times & just loves it! 

Open at 5pm everyday - make a reservation now! 

Arrivederci!",Positive,Bad,Reasonable
392,"So I've been to Banana Leaf dozens of times over the years & I just realized - no review!

What!?! Ok so here goes. 

I would often hit up BL at this location (BL has 5 locations so check Google Maps for a location that suits you) every time I went to Greek Day. 

Several blocks of Broadway are shut down on a Sunday in June in this area. 

While with family & friends enjoying the festivities of Greek Day, we just could not keep ourselves from the divine tasting food at BL!!! 

So we would break here for lunch then continue on walking around the festival! 

A friend from Toronto (who used to live here) was visiting for 2 nights & craving Asian food for dinner = BL was due for a visit! 

I really do like this location a lot & it definitely did not disappoint tonight for sure! 

We ordered the usual hits - Roti Canai, Sambal Green Bean, Pineapple Fried Rice, Caramalised Black Cod & the much missed (I love this dessert!) Pisang Goreng! 

Allergy alert - comes with peanuts! 

Gosh the salad (if I can call it that) - the Papaya Mango Kerabu - we started with was a mouth watering paradise!!! 

What I really dig about BL & I've generally always found - once seated & you've ordered - service is like - bang pronto no messing around! 

Guess what - Greek Day is coming up again soon - BL see you in June!",Positive,Good,Undefined
393,"* Good baking, coffee needs work *

This little former convenience store has had a hipster re-do and is now operating as a small bakery and coffee shop which has a few gourmet groceries for sale as well.  Considering the entire place is perhaps 700 square feet max, I was surprised by the number of staff behind the counter. It was REALLY busy behind the counter!

The spot is outfitted with a smattering of second hand furniture which gives it a homey feel, although the chairs and tables could be a bit more stable.

The cardamom knot ($3) was very fresh, with a strong buttery flavour to its pillowly dough. There was not a lot of cardamom, but it provided a distinct punch after the butter flavours hit first. This was a nice piece of baking. 4 stars.  

The coffee ($3) is from Bow & Arrows, which I normally quite like. But it was not executed very well. It had a significant amount of coffee grounds in it, which provided an unpleasant texture. Perhaps they have a leaky filter or didn't grind the coffee with the right setting for their setup?  They need to work that out, as the beans themselves I'm sure were good before they were prepared.  2 stars. 

So, for now, until they work out the issue with the coffee preparation this is a 3 star spot.  I imagine they'll figure out the coffee issue and then they should be a reliable 4 star spot.",Neutral,Good,Reasonable
394,"So this story literally begins with - I went to a pub ... (more on that later). 

The Cambie Pub + Grill (+ Hostel above) was originally going to close up shop towards the end of 2019 due to a nasty divorce - please use 'The Google' for all the info. 

By miracle it was given a reprieve & was 'saved by the bell' as the saying goes! 

The Cambie (opens at 8am everyday!) - is one of the original Vancouver pubs to still be going strong - 123 years later!!!!! 

Come on now that deserves a standing ovation!!! 

Bravo!!! 

Ok so please note this is an older pub & the owners have pretty much kept it intact way back to how it was yesteryear! 

So don't walk in expecting any type of modernization! 

I was almost expecting there to be the old 'pisspots' at the bar & under the bench tables! 

This pub is literally a walk back in time - ala the mens washroom = yikes!!! 

It could basically be categorized as a - classic pub in a very, very old sense of way!!! 

There is a hostel above the pub that draws many foreigners to it - rates must be Cheap.

You will meet all types of characters here - so if you dare enter, check your morals, vanity & ego at the door!!! 

You've been officially warned! 

A good friend of mine grew up in this pub & swears by it! He loves the simplicity of it & the old time character is what makes the Cambie stand out - in his words! 

Now of course this type of pub is not for everyone as its a real 'walk back in time' indeed! 

However, he loves the Cheap beer he's had over the years & the nostalgia of it - running into the member of a punk band & sharing beer with him (Mr Chi Pig of legendary Canadian punk rock band - SNFU. Check out YouTube). 

My punk band interest was way back in the early 80s with The Sex Pistols, The Clash & The Cure. 

Low & behold Mr Chi Pig was at the Cambie that day as well sitting a few tables from us. 

By the way, like James Bond, I do not drink beer! Hence I'm unable to rate or tell you how good the beer is - vodka's my charm! 

My friend had invited me to meet him here (his favourite pub) & chat - footy. He recommends the Burger & Brew deal that the Cambie offers - good value & taste. 

He supports my enemy team, Man United = boooooo!!! Hahaha! 

So a few weeks ago when I had popped in & on that particular day, a photographer was taking publicity shots for the pub & was asking anyone inside the pub if they wouldn't mind!? 

We said sure why not & as I said at the beginning of this from the top ... I walked into a pub & voila - the black & white pic of me was taken at the Cambie! 

The promotions manager was kind enough to email me the pic just recently. 

I do charge $10 for all screen grabs of my photo so make sure you all pay up or they'll be a knock on your door! LMAO! 

We sat with a couple guys & I met an interesting chap who was wearing on old time Man U jersey, played footy & had had dinner with the Man U chairman (saw photos) & hung out with the late great - George Best!!! 

As I'm digressing, let me end by saying please remind me one day to share this hilarious Liverpool fan joke he told us!!! 

The Cambie is located a stones throw away from the famous Water Street in Gastown, so after a few drinks you can sober up via a good walk about! 

I'm giving The Cambie top marks! Why!?? 

It's Cheap, nasty, easy & unpretentious, great for groups & the adventure begins when you walk in!!! 

If you are coming here expecting a 'classy' venue - turn around & walk away! 

To everyone I wish you all an awesome 2020 & blessings! 

May only good vibes come your way!!!!! 

Cheers!",Undefined,Good,Undefined
395,"* 2nd location - good addition to the neighbourhood! *

This new location of the classic Heritage Asian Eatery from downtown on Pender took over the old burrito space and renovated quite a bit.

The space feels bright and airy, service is friendly, and the food came out quickly.

The tastes are the same as downtown, with the freshly fried chicken that has crispy nicely rendered skin, the ginger scallion sauce reminiscent of the type you get with Hainanese chicken, delicated cooked wood ear mushroom to give chew and earthiness, a nicely marinated and slow cooked egg with a runny yolk, and a yuzu slaw that provides a cleansing to the palate after a bite of the fried chicken. 

Overall a very welcome addition to a stretch of Broadway that has seen a lot of transition recently.",Positive,Undefined,Reasonable
396,"After the Chinese New Year Parade was over, we walked around a bit looking for a place to eat. As we continued to walk up Pender Street, we saw crowds of people gathered inside and outside of this place. The crowd was most definitely a turn off, but it was obviously the restaurant of choice by so many. So we figured it would be stupid of us not to go too!

Inside was complete madness. Some of us were waiting to eat in, while the majority was waiting to pick up dim sum and desserts from the bakery. Fortunately, the bakery had a number system going on, but you really needed to pay attention or you would have easily been skipped.

The dine in area isn't that big but it was sufficient for the two of us. We really appreciated the large cups of hot tea when we got seated because it was so cold outside.

We ordered three dishes and the portions were a lot bigger than we expected. We took the rest back to our room and had leftovers for dinner.

The food we got for lunch was good. It reminded me of some of the places I go to back home in Hawaii. Each dish was about $16(CAD).

On our way out we got Egg Tarts and their ""Award Winning"" Apple Tarts. The Egg Tarts were ""ok"", but they were a little too eggy for me. But the Apple Tarts were good. Buttery and flaky and it was like eating an apple pie in the form of a ball.

Overall, a good dining experience. I would go back.",Positive,Good,Reasonable
397,"My longterm love affair with Solly's has come to an end. And it was a bad breakup. 

Despite the declining service, quality of food, and questionable cleanliness, especially over the past 2 years, I still continued to support Solly's. Their dill schmear and potato & onion knishes I will miss; the matzo balls once defrosted that could still break a window and the stale challah, I will not. 

As a longterm and frequent customer, I have heard the owner/manager eviscerate her staff (always ""in training"") on many, many occasions. The staff, who are always new because the owner is impossible to work for and/or with, are continually berated in front of customers and coworkers. 

A sign appeared in November of last year regarding orders. I misread one of the lines as ""lowering your expectations"", which I thought humorous because it actually would make ordering (and eating) at Solly's a far less frustrating process. It actually says ""exceptions"". The last line asks that customers be kind and patient with their employees. Boss lady, you are not doing a very good job of following that point yourself!

After hearing the tirade three times over that was unleashed on a very overwhelmed looking trainee, I decided to speak up. Bad idea. I told her that her trainee was ""trying her best""; evidently this was not something we agreed on. Not only did she tell me why her employee was not doing her best, she stated her staff were incapable of following food safe, and started making personal attacks on me. At this point I had no reservations in informing her that the treatment of her staff is completely unacceptable and I would no longer be making any purchases at Solly's. 

To write the innumerable (and bizarre) statements that followed and were directed my way is not worth my time -- suffice it to say, I have NEVER experienced or witnessed any other restaurant owner or manager treat their staff, or customers, that way and I am certain I won't see it again. Save for an episode or two of Kitchen Nightmares. 

Solly's: I can't, I won't, and I don't recommend that you do either.",Positive,Bad,Undefined
398,"I would have never thought Vancouver had a taco joint that is beyond amazing!  So glad the seafood restaurant we wanted to dine at was fully booked.  Luckily we stumbled upon this hidden gem.  They are located in the heart of downtown off Hastings St.  

From the outside, La Taqueria Pinche looks like an ordinary taco shop.  Once you step inside, the decor is simple and modern.  The lighting is dim with candles at every table. There is a bar area which I can imagine is jam packed during HH.  The place is small with all bar style seating.  

The service here is so friendly and attentive.  Both servers checked on us several times throughout our meal.  It must be Canadian hospitality because the people in this town are super nice.  This taco spot has a chill vibe.  IMO the tacos are quite authentic just like in LA.  

We ordered 6 ""street tacos"" for the two of us. The food was legit. 

*****Appetizer::  guacamole & chips.  I love guacamole and the one made here is legit.  Smooth and creamy.  The  chile lime tortilla chips are made in house.  So good!

*****Asada:: shredded steak with a special marinade.  Meat was so flavorful.  Served with the salsa roja. Made a bit different than in the states but delicious nonetheless!!!  My fave!  

*****Al pastor:: shredded spicy pork topped with onions and cilantro.  They add a slice of pineapple as well.  It was very tasty.  Meat also tender and well marinated. 

*****Carnitas:: braised pulled pork with pickled red onions.  The pork was tender.  Not many places can master that.  Served with a spicy salsa verde.  

****Grilled fish::  just a fish taco. 

I would definitely come here again but they are 1200 miles away.  Will do on my next trip.  A must try when in downtown Vancouver.",Positive,Undefined,Undefined
399,"Location location location ... Flourist why'd you have to be so far away!?!

I need you to open up more stores ASAP! 

Those of you familiar with the Croatian Cultural Centre (shows, dances & events) will have no issue finding this spot.

You will be coming here for a quick bite or to pick up your order (place online orders the day before) & go.

There is literally nothing around here to stay for!

Now to the good stuff - the baked goods & menu items totally rock!

Try the Best Ever Choc Chip Cookie (literally what it's called) & the Cinnamon Buns made of sourdough which rival the ones at Grounds for Coffee.

However, Flourist why don't you sell extra icing cause the only way to truly eat Cinnamon buns is when you can't see them!?!! 

Your taste buds will flip back to a time when foods were ... naturally organic in taste via the Epic Salad!!!

However, to be honest I found it to be way too healthy for me!

Yikes don't hate me cause I'm sexy!

Remember to pick up a loaf of sourdough bread as well!

Thank you for all the tips fellow Yelper - Arleen!

Newsflash Hot Tip alert - highly recommend you call ahead or place your on-line orders the day before pickup by - 3pm as required, then head down here the next day.

That way you won't be disappointed by just showing up & finding they've sold out of what you really wanted to try!

You're welcome!

More good news - Flourist caters to all you yoga loving, grass eating, health conscious fanatics - veganism is served for you right here!

Yuck!

In all seriousness please have a look at Flourists webpage in the 'about' section for an interesting read on where the grains used for baking here are sourced!

Flourist is my new hot bakery!
